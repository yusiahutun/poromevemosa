Think about who will be in the audience too; weddings typically host guests of all ages and backgrounds, so inside jokes and embarrassing stories that may make close friends and younger guests laugh could fall flat with older members of the congregation.</p><p id=ebyClQnwSC0 data-wc=39>There are some formalities you may need to cover too, including thanking certain people for planning and hosting the wedding, for attending the big day, or <a class=hm-link href=#>paying a heartfelt tribute to loved ones</a> who are missing from the occasion.</p><h2>Wedding speech template</h2><p id=e7jOS6ytzyM data-wc=28>While the style and content of your speech will be unique to you, there are a few key things you may want to include from the template below.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/be96a90ea03b-wedding-toast.jpg><li>Introduce yourself and explain your relationship to the couple.

Dos and Don'ts</a></strong></p><h2>Wedding speech tips</h2><p id=efYkwrJTYFmz data-wc=30><a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Matthew Shaw</a>, creative director and founder of <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>sauveur.</a>, shares his six top wedding speech tips to help you both when writing your speech and delivering it on the big day.</p><h3>1. Stick to an angle</h3><p id=eScobVso4BPc data-wc=98>&nbsp;"Speeches can sprawl quite easily when you're trying to cover so much and this makes them difficult to follow. When you first start planning your speech it's definitely helpful to throw lots of ideas around but then try to focus on an overall theme or approach. This could be a personality trait, great jokes, or a more heartfelt approach, but it will help you, and the guests, if there is a clear angle to follow. In turn, this will help your guests follow along and you will be gifted with a better response from the room," he recommends.</p><p id=e9Z2M_G6syZh data-wc=65>"When it comes to content, remember to keep it clean and universal. By all means poke fun at your subject with a glint in your eye, but consider who may be present and keep the shaming stories for another time. Similarly, you should consider what your audience can relate to too. No one wants to sit through a five minute private joke they don't understand!"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/f1eb5e6cbab5-best-man-speech.jpg><h3>2. Use notes rather than a script</h3><p id=e4VwZZf6u9Xp data-wc=52>&nbsp;"As much as possible, I suggest rehearsing enough so that you know the overall structure and points off by heart and then using notes as a guide on the day. Your speech will feel much more natural for this and it will also help you look up and out across the room.</p><p id=elcSXA5nm-3g data-wc=74>&nbsp;"For our weddings we often stick these into a spare order of service so they look smart and are also easier to hold and turn the page. This will also help you with your eye contact. It will help your speech feel more personal if you make eye contact around the room instead of with the floor in front of you. Whatever works for you but whatever you do, don't read off your phone!"</p><p id=eXHoSJq9tvDX data-wc=15><strong>RELATED: <a class=hm-link href=#>Pre-wedding jitters? 12 top sleep tips to feel rested and refreshed before your nuptials</a></strong></p><h3>3. Keep it short and sweet!</h3><p id=e1nTRITWL9A4 data-wc=122>&nbsp;"A tale as old as time but I really cannot stress this enough! It is very difficult to distil a friendship or relationship into a couple of minutes but you will be thanked for this, I promise. I recommend three to five minutes and no more than eight," Matthew advises. "A clear, tight, structure will help you deliver a brilliant speech and leave everyone wanting more. This is equally important on the day itself; do not go off script and meander through your thoughts. If you lose your place you can pause and refer to your notes, but do not freestyle and make it up as you go along. I have never seen a long wedding speech that has been well received."</p><h3>4. Best Speech Ever (B.S.E)</h3><p id=eDrTgJOQFK3B data-wc=40>&nbsp;"This is my acronym for putting the finishing touches on an excellent speech. Body language, speed, and energy. Once you've written your speech, the crucial next step is to rehearse it so you are comfortable with your material and delivery."</p><h4>Body language:</h4><p id=ej04aWQUMoGf data-wc=80>"Make sure you rehearse in front of the mirror so you can see how you deliver the speech. Keep an eye out for any nervous ticks you may have and what your hands are doing. Ask the couple if you will be using a microphone and, if so, practice with a hairbrush. You should hold it steady, a few centimetres from your mouth. If you wave it around as you speak you'll land up sounding like a train station announcement!"</p><h4>Speed:</h4><p id=eNff04nN1R6_ data-wc=85>&nbsp;"Remember to keep it slow. We have a habit of speaking fast when nervous, which will make it hard for your audience to follow. I suggest recording yourself so you can play it back and work out how much to slow down. It's also important to allow moments for you to pause for reaction, and to take your breath or a sip of water. If helpful, write these into your notes as a reminder. Don't try and rattle off the whole speech without any breaks."</p><h4>Energy:​​​​</h4><p id=eQWU7WJ1iqOc data-wc=50>"To avoid monotone delivery, work out the energy of each section in your speech and practice moving between different registers. This will help keep it interesting as well ensuring your audience follows along. And PRACTICE! When ready, ask a couple of trusted friends/family members to have a run through too."</p><p id=eUg9ZR8C7rb data-wc=6><strong>MORE: <a class=hm-link href=#>60 ultimate first dance songs</a></strong></p><h2>How do you start a wedding speech?</h2><p id=ebJPdhC9zasG data-wc=40>Start your wedding speech by introducing yourself and explaining your relationship to the couple.
