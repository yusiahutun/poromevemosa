That’s good news, since failing to catch regular Zzzs can negatively impact everything from your productivity and <a href=# rel=noopener>your memory</a> to your judgment and your waistline. Are you looking to upgrade your bedroom to create a more comfortable and hypoallergenic sleep environment? Choosing one of the best mattress toppers for back pain and hip pain is the perfect place to start (and buying one of the <a href=# rel=noopener>best mattresses for back and hip pain</a> is a great idea, too). Keep reading to find answers to the most commonly asked questions about mattress toppers!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What’s the difference between a mattress topper and a mattress pad?&nbsp;</h2><p>While mattress covers work to protect your bed from allergens, microbes, dust mites, and pet dander, toppers provide extra cushioning — even more so than <a href=# rel=noopener>mattress pads</a>, which are usually thinner and designed to attach to your bed like a fitted sheet.</p><p>A mattress topper, on the other hand, is typically several inches thick and sits on top of your mattress. The best mattress toppers for back pain and hip pain are typically made of a variety of materials, including cotton, memory foam, and latex, and range in size from twin to California king, with queen size being the most popular. You can also get them for cribs and children’s beds.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What are the most comfortable mattress toppers for back pain and hip pain?</h2><p>The best mattress toppers for back pain and hip pain are crafted with care to relieve joint and muscle soreness. They can even help ward off allergies — all the mattress toppers on our list are hypoallergenic.</p><p>Whether they are made from memory foam, latex, or down, these mattress toppers offer solid value and help create a soft, inviting bed that fosters relief from pain and more rejuvenating rest. Pay close attention to thickness, softness, and support when deciding on a mattress topper that will be comfortable for you.</p><p>Here are a few other things to be on the lookout for when shopping for the best mattress toppers for back pain and hip pain:</p><ul><li><strong>Certifications:</strong> Whether you’re concerned about harmful chemicals or the humane treatment of animals (down mattress toppers are made from duck and goose feathers), certifications such as the <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Responsible Down Standard</a> (RDS) and <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">CertiPUR-US</a> ensure you feel good about your new mattress topper. The <strong><a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">Parachute Down Mattress Topper</a></strong> is RDS-certified, and the <strong><a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">UTTU Respira</a></strong> and <strong><a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">Molecule Airtech</a></strong> mattress toppers are both CertiPUR-US-approved, so you can rest assured they contain no toxic materials.</li><li><strong>Care instructions:</strong> We love a mattress topper that’s machine washable and safe to throw in the dryer, but many aren’t. If ease of laundering is a consideration for you, be sure to check the product specifications. The <strong><a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">Molecule Airtec mattress topper</a></strong> has a washer-and-dryer safe mattress cover, making it easy to care for. (Check out this helpful article on <a href=# rel=noopener>how to clean a mattress</a>, as well.)</li><li><strong>Temperature regulation:</strong> Night sweats disturbing your sleep? Look for a cooling mattress topper, like the <strong><a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">LUCID Ventilated Gel Memory Foam mattress topper</a></strong>.</li></ul><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What kind of mattress is best for lower back pain?</h2><p>Pairing your mattress topper with <a href=# rel=noopener>the best mattress for back and hip pain</a> will increase your comfort factor many times over. (Though some people swear by the <a href=# rel=noopener>best recliner chairs for sleeping</a>, as an alternative!). Look for a mattress made with memory foam, which conforms to your body to relieve pressure points and reduce aches and pains.</p><p><strong>Some of the best mattresses for back and hip pain include:</strong></p><ul><li><a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">The Layla Hybrid Mattress (Buy from Layla Sleep, $1,449)</a></li><li><a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">TEMPUR-ProAdapt (Buy from Tempur-Pedic, $3,099)</a></li><li><a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">Nectar Premium Copper Memory Foam Mattress (Buy from Nectar, $1,699)</a></li></ul><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Is memory foam good for back and hip pain?</h2><p>Yes! Memory foam is one of the very best materials to ease back pain, hip pain, and really any kind of discomfort. Not only does it conform to your curves to offer customized softness and support, it doesn’t transfer heat, making for a cool and comfortable night’s rest. Layer a memory foam mattress topper on your bed, add a few of <a href=# rel=noopener>the best pillows for neck and shoulder pain</a>, and you’ll feel like you’re sleeping on a soft, supportive cloud!</p><p>For even more pain relief, investing in one of the <a href=# rel=noopener>best adjustable bed frames</a>, along with one of the <a href=# rel=noopener>best split adjustable beds</a> to pair with your mattress topper, can do wonders when it comes to sleeping in comfort (and don’t forget one of the <a href=# rel=noopener>best down alternative comforters</a>) — the possibilities are endless!</p><p><strong>Keep scrolling for FIRST for Women’s picks to find the best mattress topper for back pain and hip pain!</strong></p><p>First For Women has affiliate partnerships so we may receive compensation for some links to products and services.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>18 Best Mattress Toppers for Back Pain and Hip Pain of 2021</h2><h2 class=block-product__title><a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">PlushBeds 100% Natural Latex Topper</a></h2><span class=block-product__eyebrow>Best Latex Mattress Topper</span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/08/best-mattress-topper-for-bad-back.jpg><p><strong><a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">Buy from PlushBeds, starting at $216 for Queen (originally $445)</a></strong></p><h3 class=block-product-list__title>Why we like it:</h3><ul><li>Customizable support — choose from soft, medium, medium-firm, or extra-firm</li><li>Option to add an organic cotton topper for just $75</li><li>Certifications by OEKO-TEX Standard 100 and GreenGuard Gold ensure the highest product quality standards</li></ul><p>PlushBeds 100 percent <strong><a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">natural Talalay latex topper</a></strong> is definitely one of the best mattress toppers for back pain and hip pain you can buy.
