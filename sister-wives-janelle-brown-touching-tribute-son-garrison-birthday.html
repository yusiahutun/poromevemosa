"I am extremely grateful now that we had pictures taken."</p><p>In late March, Janelle opened up about how she's doing as she continues to grieve the loss of her son. In an emotional post on Instagram, she expressed gratitude to those who have sent their support following her son's death, and shared photos from Garrison's "beautiful" celebration of life ceremony last month.</p><p>"It's been hard to get my brain to work properly again. I am so grateful for the out pouring of love and support I've received these last three weeks," began Janelle.</p><p>"The support has been overwhelming. I am honored. So many of you shared stories of your loved ones," she continued. "So many of you wrote of your thoughts and prayers. Thank you from the bottom of my heart ‚ù§Ô∏è."</p><p>The mom of six said that her son "was honored by family members and by his National Guard Unit last Sunday at a celebration of life ceremony," adding that Garrison "would have loved it."</p><p>"I am sharing some of the photos. Many you have already seen a lot of these online, often with snarky comments accompanying them," Janelle concluded. "But this was a beautiful moment for us."</p><a id=gallery-link-ca2302bd-739c-4c66-b023-99df4519da20 class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:ca2302bd-739c-4c66-b023-99df4519da20 data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:e6c94b71-3ce1-45e9-9498-c9ddf8992bb2 data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/5f/4by3/2024/04/08/5f4de120fe8a414c8a5dc9a5efb5dc58_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3V7j21mamlfqLa0wMSrZLChpprAbrbAp5ylpJVir7O71qdkraelmLWqusZmq6uhkqrBpnnSqKVmn5Gnv6q%2Fzqdkm6GiqbWlrdho</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./article-f97d0e26-825f-11ee-8ec0-4fcd8158c396-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Tornadoes route Rams in playoffs debut | Sports">&larr;
