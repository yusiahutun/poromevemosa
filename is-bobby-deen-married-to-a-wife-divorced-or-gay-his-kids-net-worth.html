Bobby Deen, along with his mother and older brother, is the owner of The Lady & Sons restaurant in Savannah, Georgia. His mother also hosts the show Paula’s Home Cooking and Paula’s Party, in which Bobby participates in addition to the show Road Tasted, which he started with his brother. However, as the family business expanded and became more sophisticated, the two brothers left the show to focus on the family restaurant.</p><p>After several years, Bobby Deen returned to the airwaves with his personal cooking show, Not My Mama’s Meals, which began in January 2012. His new cooking show was not only about cooking and eating, but he reworked his mother’s recipes into healthier recipes.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Bobby’s Net Worth</strong></h2><p>Bobby Deen was the host of the Kochsitcom Holiday Baking Championship and Spring Baking Championship, which were broadcast on Food Network. In the series Junk Food Flip, which aired on Cooking Channel, the talented chef co-hosted the show. Together with his brother, he produced the television show Southern Fried Road Trip, which was broadcast on Food Network in 2015, with the aim of discovering first-class locally produced delicacies.</p><p>Among the other notable works, the talented chef has ventured into is acting. His good looks have also drawn attention to him, as he was named one of the “50 Most Eligible Bachelors” by People Magazine in 2006.</p><p>The celebrity chef, who has appeared in several shows, including the shows he hosts, has amassed a fair amount of wealth from his activities, and his net worth is currently estimated at $5 million.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Kids, Is Bobby Deen Married To A Wife, Divorced Or Gay?</strong></h2><p>The celebrity chef is happily married to his long-time girlfriend Claudi Lovera, whom he allegedly met in a gym. The two got engaged on April 24, 2013, and in July 2013 they entered into the bond of marriage in a ceremony that took place at the home of Paula Deen.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Chris Distefano Wife, Girlfriend, Age, Daughter, Facts About The Comedian</a></strong></p><p>Claudia, who has written about health issues for Savannah Morning News/Savannahnow.com, is currently the owner of The Trendy Smoothie website, which also covers health and lifestyle. On her website in September, she revealed that she was expecting triplets, and although the pregnancy was very hard for her, they are looking forward to becoming parents.</p><p>Back in 2013, when rumors about his sexuality were rampant, Bobby Deen made it clear that he was a heterosexual man and removed all doubt when he announced his engagement to Claudia during the broadcast of Fox Morning News.</p><p>If you are among those who wonder if the marriage of the handsome cook has fallen apart, we are happy to inform you that Bobby Deen and his wife are having the best time of their lives, there is no sign of the two separatings.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>His Food Addiction</strong></h2><p>Behind the present glamorous life of the celebrity chef is his former addiction to food. Yes, the celebrity chef had his weak moments with the one thing he loves to prepare. Bobby revealed that in his teenage years he found comfort in food when things didn’t go well in his life. He remembered the time when his family had to move and the thought of starting a new life pushed him to eat too much. Even after his parents divorced, he started eating unusually much again, and his weight shot up.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Chris Kattan Gay, Height, Age, Mother, Wife, How Did He Break His Neck?</a></strong></p><p>After his parents divorced, the next thing Bobby thought about was the restaurant his mother was trying to build. He got lost in all the hustle and bustle and neglected his body, but eventually, he confided in Terrel Moody, who had a perfectly trimmed physique for a 19-year-old, and he told Bobby that he knew the right person to help him get back in shape. When Bobby began his training sessions under the guidance of a trainer named Carter, he had to brave all adversity to maintain his routine, as his culinary family did not regularly fully support his absence from the restaurant.</p><p>With great tenacity and perseverance, the chef transformed into a dashing young man who now has a new perspective on food and exercise that has greatly influenced his approach to cooking. Bobby also plays an important role in his mother’s life to help her adopt healthy eating habits in her struggle with type 2 diabetes since she was diagnosed in 2012.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7XLsmWcp51ktrR5waiZm7FdmbKmuoymmKuqmZqxbsDOZphmr5mbsm6wyK%2Bmq5uVmXqwvoygmLJlmJ7AbrfInapmppWperi70a2faA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./peanut-butter-acorns-recipe-clx1014.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Peanut Butter Acorns Recipe">&larr;
