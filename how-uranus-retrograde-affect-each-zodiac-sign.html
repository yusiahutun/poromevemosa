In fact, it can sometimes pave the way for beautiful revelations that change the way you see yourself. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Uranus retrograde 2023 will affect each zodiac sign</a> starting August 28—at 10:39 p.m. ET, to be exact. It will launch a period of personal reflection and internal growth and it might even inspire you to make some major life changes. After all, everything can change in one moment, and since it rains diamonds on Uranus, who knows what gems you’re about to stumble upon in the wake of this powerful shift?</p><p>In astrology, Uranus is the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">planet of rebellion and innovation</a>. Although its influence tends to bring instability and unpredictability, it also paves the way for sudden changes that revolutionize the world. Although it’s normal to feel terrified of change, Uranus understands that sometimes, you need to rip off the band air and embrace something different!</p><p>However, while <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Uranus is retrograde</a>, its influence becomes more tempered and inverted. Instead of evoking change on an external level, Uranus begins to transform your world internally. Instead of changing the world around you, Uranus encourages you to be the one doing the changing. Until January 27, 2024, this five-month-long retrograde will inspire you to deepen your sense of independence and strengthen your resolve in your own unique self.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Copy-of-List-Redirect-Design-5.png><p>Because this retrograde begins takes place in Taurus, a luxurious earth sign known for its association with money, you can can expect this retrograde to shine a light <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">on your finances</a>, your investments and your sense of security. And because Taurus is ruled by Venus—planet of love —you can also expect it to bring you epiphanies regarding your relationships, your friendships and support system.</p><p>In the end, Uranus stations retrograde so that it can show you how to be the person you want to be (as long as it’s on your own terms and at your own pace). Here is how Uranus retrograde will affect you, based on your <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">sun sign</a> and/or <a href=# sponsored=true rel=sponsored>rising sign</a>:</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/astrologynewslettersignup.png><ul class="pmc-fallback-list-items lrv-a-unstyle-list lrv-u-margin-t-2"><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1.417667238422><h2>Aries</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Aries.png><p>Your finances might be in flux (and this upcoming Uranus retrograde will make you realize why). Taking place in your second house of money, this retrograde is encouraging you to rethink your relationship with your material possessions. Before you commit to a financial plan, budget, or go on a shopping spree, try to understand what it is you’re trying to gain from this purchase. You don’t need fancy items to define you. Let your spirit and heart speak to the person you are on the inside. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Read your full monthly horoscope</a>.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=0.94416243654822><h2>Taurus</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Taurus.png><p>Step out of your way and open your mind to new philosophies! After all, Uranus is stationing retrograde in Taurus, forcing you to rethink your identity and your unique sense of self. Are you living on someone else’s terms? It’s time to take back the reigns over your life. Holding onto the past will be a disservice to you, as you’re moving forward with plans and evolving at rampant speed. Allow yourself to transform. This will give you the opportunity to see life from a different perspective. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Read your full monthly horoscope.</a></p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1.9001610305958><h2>Gemini</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Gemini.png><p>In the recent past, you haven’t wanted to make any changes in your life because you fear the unknown. However, you might be feeling more open-minded than ever, which is encouraging you to take the necessary steps towards growth that are needed at the moment. Now, you can do so without hesitation because you’re not scared. When Uranus stations retrograde in your 12th house of spirituality and inner knowing, it may cause repressed memories to come out swinging.

Be open to aligning with people with whom you would never have previously considered friends, because Uranus is stationing retrograde in your 11th house of community. You have more in common with certain people than you think, because you might find that your understanding of a group dynamic is evolving. Plus, people are starting to surprise you!

This may be causing you to feel majorly frustrated, especially if you’ve been feeling dependent on a certain level of success in order to feel satisfied with yourself. You’re learning that you don’t have to move so fast in your career. Professional growth takes time. Let it happen and unfold naturally and try not to rush the process.

As Uranus stations retrograde in your ninth house of wisdom, philosophy and travel, you may be on the verge of a great adventure. However, this adventure is less about exploring the great beyond and more about exploring the great within. You may find that taking a class or going back to school will do your mind some good, as it’ll introduce you to many like-minded people who share your intellectual ideals and pursuits. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Read your full monthly horoscope</a>.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=0.94539249146758><h2>Libra</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Libra.png><p>Unexpected money from a random acquaintance could put you in a better financial place, so wait for some breaking news surrounding your finances! As Uranus stations retrograde in your eighth house of wills and investments, you may find that you’re finally getting the pay day you’ve been waiting for. Let yourself revel in the extra funding and opt to save it for the future instead of spending impulsively on items that you may not want or like in the upcoming weeks ahead.

Although Scorpios can definitely stand the heat in the kitchen, Uranus retrograde will help you cool things down. Even though the drama isn’t likely to stop anytime soon, it will slow down as you are able to see what wasn’t working in your dynamic. Save your judgments, especially before you rush into an argument when there doesn’t need to be a struggle.

Because Uranus is stationing retrograde in your sixth house of to-do lists, it’s reinventing the way you get work done. It’s time to test out new methods that allow you to manage your time more meaningfully.

As Uranus stations retrograde in your third house of communication, it could sharpen your clarity to a high degree, encouraging you to finally come out and get something off your chest. It’s time to speak firmly and truly about what you think and believe, even if it alienates you from people who don’t understand it.
