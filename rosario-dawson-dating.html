As an obvious beauty and talented actress, you may be wondering <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">who Rosario Dawson is dating now</a>. And we have all of the details.&nbsp;</p><p>Rosario Dawson has been on the movie scene for quite some time, with some of her memorable titles being Wonder Woman (the animated 2009 version and Wonder Woman: Bloodlines), Rent, and Grindhouse.</p><p>As her <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">acting status</a> grew into the spotlight, so did her dating partners. In 2018, the television personality revealed she identifies as a part of the LGBTQ+ community in a supportive <a href=# rel=nofollow>Instagram post</a>. “People kept saying that I [came out]… I didn’t do that,” she said in an interview with <a href=# rel=nofollow>Bustle</a> two years later. “I mean, it’s not inaccurate, but I never did come out come out. I mean, I guess I am now.” At the time of this interview she was dating <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Senator</a> Cory Booker, but let’s see who Rosario Dawson is dating now, shall we?&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=who-is-rosario-dating>Who is Rosario dating?</h2><p>Here’s a rundown of her lovers, past and present.</p><ul class="pmc-fallback-list-items lrv-a-unstyle-list lrv-u-margin-t-2"><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=4.4139030612245><h2>Nnamdi Okafor (2022 – present)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/GettyImages-1422664511.jpg><p>Rosario Dawson is now dating Nnamdi Okafor, a philanthropic strategist for California State University, whom she met at a bar in Southern California. The Zookeeper actress confirmed the new relationship on <a href=# rel=nofollow>Instagram</a> in August 2022 with a heartwarming video in which both Okafor and Dawson said “I love you.”&nbsp;</p><p>“He’s in that same space of wanting to be of service,” Rosario said to <a href=# rel=nofollow>PEOPLE</a> in October 2022. “And I think that’s one of the things we get along on, though he did introduce himself first as a poet.” The Haunted Mansion star doesn’t often post about her personal relationships, so it’s safe to assume that she and Okafor are still going strong until told otherwise.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=6.2255668491009><h2>Cory Booker (2018 – 2022)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/GettyImages-1176121523.jpg><p>Rosario Dawson from men in the entertainment industry to dating Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey. The two met at the political fundraiser of a mutual friend in the summer of 2018, in which the Men in Black ll actress explained they “talked for hours and hours” that night (per <a href=# rel=nofollow>The Washington Post</a>). Dawson then confirmed the relationship to <a href=# rel=nofollow>TMZ</a> in an airport run-in in March 2019. “I am just grateful to be with someone that I respect and love and admire so much,” Dawson said. The two seemed to be going strong for four years, with Rosario even making a surprise appearance on<a href=# rel=nofollow> Jimmy Kimmel Live</a> with Booker and describing him as the “Ted Lasso of the Senate” in a second <a href=# rel=nofollow>TMZ</a> interview.&nbsp;</p><p>Due to Booker’s political status and presidential aspirations, Dawson told <a href=# rel=nofollow>Bustle</a> that “It’s the first time I felt like I had to be responsible about my choice of love, which is a challenging thing to do.” The activist then moved into the politician’s home in Newark, New Jersey, in May 2020. So, what went wrong? It’s unclear exactly why the relationship ran its course, but <a href=# rel=nofollow>PEOPLE</a> confirmed through a source in February 2022 that they were no longer dating but remain good friends.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=7.1037463976945><h2>Eric Andre (2016 – 2017)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/GettyImages-1490993068.jpg><p>Even Chance the Rapper needed text confirmation of Rosario Dawson’s relationship with comedian Eric Andre. In April 2017 on <a href=# rel=nofollow>The Late Show with Stephen Cobert</a>, the Marvel star told Cobert, “He started posting more pictures of, like, our tongues touching and stuff, like personal pictures,” due to Chance the Rapper’s disbelief of their dating.&nbsp;</p><p>Dawson explained that Andre took care of her after emergency surgery for a ruptured cyst on her ovary, claiming that he aided her while she was in an adult diaper. Per W Magazine, Dawson said of the hospitalized incident in a since-deleted Instagram post, “It was the first time I told @ericfuckingandre that I loved him (and very much not the last).” Andre confirmed the relationship on Valentine’s Day 2017 in a <a href=# rel=nofollow>sweet picture</a> with a koala bear. In November 2017, <a href=# rel=nofollow>US Weekly</a> broke the news of the split. “It just ran its course. He was never something serious,” a source told the publication.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=0.46966292134831><h2>Joshua Jackson (2002-2003)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/GettyImages-1446322573.jpg><p>Dawson’s Creek fans surely recognize Joshua Jackson. Rosario Dawson dated the television star for about a year in 2002, but they kept their relationship relatively private (this <a href=# rel=nofollow>Pinterest photo</a> is pretty much the only evidence of them dating). The duo were <a href=# rel=nofollow>photographed</a> back in May 2018, so they seem to be on good terms since the break up approximately 20 years prior.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1.4626436781609><h2>Jason Lewis (2004 – 2006)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/GettyImages-106982134.jpg><p>Rosario Dawson was linked to Sex and the City star, Jason Lewis, beginning in 2004. The pair were pictured attending several premieres together, including Cirque Du Soleil’s Delirium and Sin City. Dawson and Lewis were together for two years and were reportedly living in Los Angeles together before their break up in 2006. According to <a href=# rel=nofollow>Hollywood.com</a>, the actress was overheard talking about the split to a friend at a New York restaurant.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=6.7488789237668><h2>Mathieu Schreyer (2008 – 2011)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/GettyImages-84770531.jpg><p>Nothing like the paparazzi to spot a new couple. Dawson was seen on a shopping spree with boyfriend, Mathieu Schreyer, in January 2008 (per <a href=# rel=nofollow>Just Jared</a>). The French DJ and The Mandalorian star were seen holding hands a year later, in a video posted by <a href=# rel=nofollow>Hollywood.TV</a>. At this time, Dawson was gaining traction for her goddess role in Percy Jackson & The Olympians: The Lightning Thief.&nbsp;</p><p>A source told US Weekly that their break up in May 2011 was due to his personality. The source explained, “I know her close friends did not love his personality. He wasn’t the smiley type of guy,” According to the source, the actress initiated the breakup, claiming, “She was the one who ended it.” Just the year before, Schreyer and Dawson were photographed taking a romantic stroll along Venice Beach (via <a href=# rel=nofollow>Daily Mail</a>).</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=10.789594491201><h2>Danny Boyle (2012 – 2013)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/GettyImages-164064193.jpg><p>Dawson started dating director, Danny Boyle, in 2012. The pair worked together on Trance and were rumored to break up after an awkward run-in at the press junket. “From the outside, it looks like there’s a lot of dissimilarities, but we actually have a lot in common. We’re really similar people. He’s a very kind man,” Dawson said of Boyle, according to a secondary source US Weekly &nbsp;(likely referring to the 23-year age gap, with Boyle being older).&nbsp;</p><p>That same article claimed there was tension at the Trance press junket in which a source said that the duo was “no longer a couple.” Dawson and Boyle were said to dispel those rumors shortly after by hitting the red carpet for the movie premiere, in which they were laughing and touching, per <a href=# rel=nofollow>Hello! Magazine</a>. Yet, only nine days later, the movie actress indeed confirmed the break up with the British filmmaker in a 2013 Net-A-Porter interview that has since been removed (<a href=# rel=nofollow>Daily Mail</a>).&nbsp;</p><p>“I love Danny. He’s wonderful and we dated longer than people think we did. When the first photograph of us came out, everyone was like, ‘That’s when they started dating,’” Rosario added in the interview. Ending on good terms with your ex is a win all around.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57y6Kqratfp7y0rdGipmackazAsLqMnZitoZ6cfA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./adira-allure-actress-wiki-age-net-worth-photos-videos-biography-more.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Adira Allure (Actress) Wiki, Age, Net Worth, Photos, Videos, Biography &amp;amp; More">&larr;
