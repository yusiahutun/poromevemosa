The first one, between <a href=#>romantic Venus</a> and head-in-the-clouds Neptune, puts you in a dreamy frame of mind and encourages you to go after romantic opportunities that come your way. A second sextile, this time between curious Mercury <a href=#>and fierce Mars</a>, is a lot more intense and pushes you to work harder to pursue your desires. Both of these aspects show you what life could be like when you really go for what you want, but it’s up to you how hard you want to push to make it happen.</p><p>Here’s what you can expect from the upcoming week, according to <a href=#>your sun</a> and/or <a href=#>rising sign</a> (and seriously, you’re missing out if you don’t read these horoscopes for your rising sign):</p><h2 class=hide-small><strong>How the Planets Will Affect Your Zodiac Sign This Week</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Aries.png><p>You’re starting your week and month thinking about your personal values when Mercury enters Taurus and your wealth zone on Monday.
