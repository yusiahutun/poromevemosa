The reason we produced good music, unlike these days where musicians produce fake music due to pressure. They have accepted fans to drive them. They do what their fans want, not what they are supposed to do. Also, they are up to pleasing their fans which in the end makes them release fake music.

I was born in 1973 and am of age to lead people.<p class=align-left>He also clarified his educational background during the campaigning period. He stated that he was a graduate of Tennessee Valley University in the United States.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/5ca5cdb4a40d35bb.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=33><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Jo Koy: net worth, son, wife, house, parents, height, siblings</span></p></a><h3>Ragga Dee's wife and children</h3><p class=align-left>The singer is married to the love of his life, Mariam Kazibwe.

The singer has an estimated net worth of<a href=#> $4 million</a>. He is ranked as one of the wealthiest musicians in Uganda.</p><p class=align-left>Even though music is his primary source of income, he takes part in other money-making ventures too.
