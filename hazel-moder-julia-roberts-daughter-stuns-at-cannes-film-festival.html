After meeting on the set of the movie “The Mexican”&nbsp; in 2000, Julia and Daniel left their previous partners to start a relationship.</p><p>The pair kept the early stages of the romance unknown even till they got married in a secret ceremony in 2002.&nbsp; Daniel and Julia wasted no time in starting a family together.&nbsp;</p><p>The couple welcomed their first children, fraternal twins Hazel Patricia and Phinneas “Finn” Walter. Danny and Julia added their kids just two years after their secret wedding in Taos, New Mexico.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.pinimg.com/564x/cf/2d/64/cf2d6417bdf2ea53abdf0574bab025df.jpg><p>The pair <a href=#>completed </a>their family when they added their third child and son Henry Daniel. But, like their relationship, Julia is extra cautious about what she posts about her kids on social media.&nbsp;</p><p>However, she gives her fans an occasional glimpse into her family. For example, she once posted a cute throwback of her twins as twins on their 17th birthday. The kids previously lived with their parents outside of Los Angeles at a property in malibu before they relocated to San Francisco during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>Hazel and Phinneaus are preparing to go to college, which their mother never did. The veteran actress has, however, voiced her enthusiasm about the experiences awaiting her kids in college.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Hazel_Moder_Stuns_At_Cannes_Film_Festival></span><strong>Hazel Moder Stuns At Cannes Film Festival</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Julia Robert’s 16-year-old daughter Hazel Moder made a surprise appearance at the 2021 edition of the Cannes Film Festival. The young beauty made her red carpet debut in her father’s company, Daniel Moder.</p><p>The young girl, who hardly makes any public appearance, was at the festival to support her father. The older Moder served as the cinematographer for the festival film ‘Flag Day.”</p><p>While Daniel <a href=#>donned </a>a tuxedo, Hazel kept it stylish and simple with a butterscotch yellow button-up lace dress. Father and daughter wore their best smiles as they posed together for photographs on the red carpet.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-pinterest wp-block-embed-pinterest"></figure><p>Hazel’s appearance at the festival shocked most people, considering how private Julia and Daniel keep their affairs. She’s the only one of her siblings to step out in a Hollywood scenario so far.</p><p>Although neither Hazel nor Phinneaus has shown any interest in following in their mother’s footsteps, they wouldn’t have any problems if they decided to take on Hollywood.&nbsp;</p><p>Apart from their mother, who is a veteran Hollywood star, their cousin Emma Roberts is also an actress. Emma’s father, Eric Roberts, an actor, is their uncle, so acting runs in the family.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Julia_Roberts_Keeps_Her_Kids_Away_From_The_Spotlight></span><strong>Julia Roberts Keeps Her Kids Away From The Spotlight</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Since giving birth to her kids, Julia and her cameraman husband, Danny Moder, have kept the kids away from the spotlight. Speaking to Oprah Winfrey, Julia explains although she has millions of fans for her kids, she is just a mother. Julia <a href=#>disclosed</a>:</p><p><strong>“I don’t think they will ever have a true sense of [her fame]. I think I told you once, when they were starting to figure it out, it was like, ‘You’re famous?’ And I said, ‘I think a lot of people might have seen the movie I’m in or know who I am.’ Maybe an hour goes by. ‘Are you more famous than Taylor Swift?</strong></p><p>In the interview, Julia and Oprah also discussed how tabloids regularly pick out their relationship. The actress explained she couldn’t imagine the amount of scrutiny they would face if they had kids weekly.</p><p>According to Julia, there would be a story about her leaving Daniel or the cinematographer leaving her every week. Oprah and the mother of three bonded over the experience since they have both encountered it.</p><p>Oprah then asked Julia how she had been able to keep her kids away from the tabloid news. The actress <a href=#>replied</a>:</p><p><strong>“Sometimes we are in the grocery store, and I won’t even know something is out, but we’ll see a tabloid, and we’ll all be standing there like, ‘Oh, that’s uncomfortable. This is uncomfortable.’ Yet, it can still hurt my feelings because I’m so proud of my marriage. We celebrated being married for 16 years this Fourth of July, and there’s so much happiness wrapped up in what we’ve found together.</strong></p><p>After years of those experiences, Julia disclosed that it doesn’t phase her anymore. However, she has been able to control some of the narratives with her Instagram posts.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Julia_Roberts_%E2%80%9CGaslit%E2%80%9D_Performances_Praised></span><strong>Julia Roberts’ “Gaslit” Performances Praised</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>After a long hiatus, Julia Roberts returned to the small screen on the political series “Gaslit.” The actress who <a href=#>stunned </a>viewers with her performance in “Pretty Woman” alongside Richard Gere earlier in her career replicated her superb execution in “Gaslit.”</p><p>“Gaslit,” tells the story of Martha Mitchell [Julia Roberts], the first person to disclose Nixon’s involvement in Watergate publicly. Veteran actor Sean Penn portrays Attorney General John N Mitchell and Julia’s husband.&nbsp;</p><p>After the Starz series <a href=#>aired</a>, critics praised Julia’s performance and that of Penn for how they brought the story to life. Unfortunately, although the series has received positive reviews, Starz has not renewed it for a second season.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51ktaLGxKVkpqeUmr9uttSloJploqSvpr7TrGSdmaWctbWx0Waqra2eqHqiwIycmKemlah6p7XLpmSfnaOptrety2g%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./demi-lovatos-weight-loss-1228644.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Empowering Story of Demi Lovatos Weight Loss Journey">&larr;
