However, there are some celebrities who have kept their lives hidden from the public eyes.&nbsp; Khandi Alexander is one of them, and she has saved her personal life fully concealed from the spotlight. Khandi Alexander, 64, has yet to confirm whether or if she is married.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-606 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Let's have a look at his personal life.</p><h2>Is Khandi Alexander Married?</h2><p>Khandi Alexander is one of those actresses who prefers not to reveal too much about their personal life and stay as low-key as possible.

Besides that, she has not even mentioned&nbsp;having a boyfriend. So there is very less information about her personal life, and we can’t be sure if she is married or not. But several websites report that she is single and is not married till now. However, this remains speculation as she never confirmed it.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-607 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Khandi has never married, even though she is 64 years old, leading to suspicion that she is gay or lesbian.

Because she is not married or has a boyfriend, several websites suggest she has a lesbian personality. On the other hand, Khandi did not respond to the rumor, which caused it to fade away over time.</p><p>It is a disappointment as Khandi never shares critical information about her personal life, but we are still hoping that someday he will share her precious moments with the world.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-608 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>Also:&nbsp;<a href=# rel=follow>All on Samaire Armstrong's Dating History- Has She Been Married?</a></p><p>Khandi's personal life is kept private, while her work life is exposed to the public.
