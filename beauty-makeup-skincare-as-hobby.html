It covered the topic of so-called “girl hobbies,” and proposed that participating in beauty rituals is, in fact, a hobby. Is a monthly hair color appointment considered a hobby? A routine brow appointment? Shopping for skincare? I wasn’t so sure.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Trying to fall asleep that night, I ruminated on the idea. If golfing and knitting and cooking are hobbies, then surely beauty can be, too. But I still felt a bit of hesitation at unilaterally accepting the idea, because while they may be leisurely activities for some, beauty treatments are a mandatory chore for others. Can something be both a hobby and a requirement for social acceptance?</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I wrote an <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/beauty/makeup/a36144559/jenna-rosenstein-30th-birthday-beauty-essay/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="essay touching on this three years ago" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>essay touching on this three years ago</u></a>, when Covid anxiety was still at its peak and before getting pregnant with my son, who is now almost two. I felt unsure at the time about whether I would ever return to my full-out beauty routine. The world had changed, and so had my relationship with makeup, skincare, hair care, and cosmetic treatments. At the time, I felt free of the pressure to need them. At the time, I didn’t even want them, despite my job as Bazaar’s beauty director. But now? I’m a tired working mom who is rarely alone, so stepping away for an hour-long manicure feels like I booked a vacation to Baha Mar. Getting Botox feels like Christmas Day. I have had two spa treatments since giving birth—I cried out of gratitude both times.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">At its best, beauty is a powerful reminder that I matter. My physical being matters. The way I feel about myself matters. I’m a better mom when my bangs are trimmed and my nails are buffed. Lying in bed that night, I had won the argument in my head. If beauty is fun and relaxing to you, then go ahead and call it a hobby. I began to feel silly for even doubting it could be one in the first place.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Because what is a hobby, anyway? Bazaar's associate beauty editor Katie Intner says it’s anything you can talk about passionately. (For her, working out qualifies.) Passive hobbies, like reading and watching TV, can inspire creativity. Physical hobbies, like crocheting or growing squash, bolster pride in a job well done. Beauty can do those things too. Even mundane household tasks, like laundry or grocery shopping, can become hobbies if you devote enough brainpower to become the best at them.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Is painting your nails more superficial than, say, gardening? Maybe, but that doesn’t make it any less important. Funnily enough, I believe it was my father—a big, burly police officer—who taught me that.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">When I was eight or nine years old, my mom had taken me for a manicure at a spa. I felt so proud to have my nails done, and I chose a glittery fuchsia polish. When I got home, I noticed a chip on my pointer finger. I burst into tears. Devastated, I blamed myself. How could I have ruined it already?</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">My dad was the one who sprung into action. He put me in the car and drove me to our nearest drugstore. We stood side by side in the beauty aisle, taking our time to find a polish that was a close enough match. I so clearly remember the bottle we picked—it was from Maybelline’s (now defunct) Wet Shine Diamonds line. When we got home, he helped me meticulously paint over the chip, so it was barely noticeable before I went to school the next day. My dad never once made me feel silly or stupid for caring about traditionally feminine things. What a blessing it is to have the hobbies that matter to you validated by the people you love.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">That one simple gesture from my dad could have been the butterfly-effect moment that ultimately brought me here, to my current role as beauty director. In this job, I spend a lot of time thinking about the ways beauty touches our lives. It does keep me up at night frequently. I laugh at the trending TikToks, I bookmark the hair tutorials, I worry about what it all means for young girls. I people-watch at Sephora and Ulta on the weekends, and I spend time with you in my DMs, answering questions about mascaras and serums and fillers. There are endless ways to occupy the time with beauty as your chosen hobby—from shopping and treatments to education and content.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">That brings me to the page you’re on right now. I am kicking off this column, “Notes From the Beauty Department,” as a place for our expert editors to write openly and honestly about what’s happening in our world. You’ll get to know more about the makeup looks lighting up our Slack chats, the trends we’re trying, and of course, the products and treatments we love. I hope you’ll visit often, to check out each new edition, and that this series becomes a small, shiny new facet of your beauty hobby—or at the very least, something to read as you sit in the pedicure chair.</p><img alt=text title=text width=743 height=920 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/headshot-65e1f5bb452c1.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/a5b794e4-ba0e-4527-9e9d-e98142b9fbef_1526586861.jpg alt="Headshot of Jenna Rosenstein" title="Headshot of Jenna Rosenstein" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Jenna Rosenstein is the Beauty Director at Harper's BAZAAR across both print and digital. While attending NYU, she held internships at Women’s Wear Daily, Bloomingdale’s, Harper’s BAZAAR, and Allure, the latter of which she parlayed into her first job as the Beauty Assistant. She left Allure three years later as the Senior Beauty Editor. She spent a few months at Refinery29 overseeing branded content in the same title, before finally landing back at BAZAAR to manage all beauty content. When she's not testing every lipstick known to mankind, getting zapped by new lasers, or interviewing experts and celebrities, you can find Rosenstein at home in New Jersey with her son, husband, and black cat named Maddie.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfl7KiwdOyZppsZm2Ec3%2BPamabnZGqwbp5zJqinq2gYsCstc2cmKudXZbAbrTOm5myZw%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./the-divorce-of-george-jones-and-tammy-wynette.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Divorce of George Jones and Tammy Wynette">&larr;
