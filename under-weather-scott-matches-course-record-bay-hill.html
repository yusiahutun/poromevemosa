One majestic round with the putter made him feel a lot better on Thursday.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Scott made five putts from about 20 feet or longer, two of them for eagle and one of them from off the green for birdie, and matched the course record with a 10-under 62 to build a four-shot lead in the Arnold Palmer Invitational.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The conditions were close to perfect. So was his work on the greens.</p><figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure class="css-1yuz473 exv1azg4">There’s a lot of different ways to get the ball in the hole. But it’s good for the confidence. It’s what I wanted.Adam Scott</figure><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I made a lot of putts today, and a lot of putts from considerable length,” Scott said. “I hit a lot of nice shots, too, but it wasn’t like I was hitting it 4 feet. I had a round like this in Australia at the end of last year – in the first six holes, I didn’t hit it outside 5 feet. There’s a lot of different ways to get the ball in the hole. But it’s good for the confidence. It’s what I wanted. I sat in here yesterday and said I’d like to make some birdies and build the confidence. And today is a good start to that.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Ryo Ishikawa, who uses Bay Hill as his home course on the East Coast, birdied the 18th for a 65. John Merrick celebrated his 32nd birthday by reaching 8 under until a late bogey. He also shot 65.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Both were 10 shots behind before they hit their first shot of the tournament.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“That took the pressure off,” Merrick said. “You’re already 10 shots behind, so it’s not like you’re protecting anything. But this isn’t the Bay Hill I remember. I don’t usually play golf in Florida without 20 mph wind.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Gonzalo Fernandez-Castano had his best round of the year with a 66. Brandt Snedeker and Paul Casey were among those at 67. They were all but forgotten with Scott’s 62 on the board.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Scott walked from the ninth green across the practice range to the scoring trailer as one player after another turned his head and asked how low Scott went on the day. One caddie quipped, “Is there a 10-shot rule when you haven’t teed off?”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It was the lowest round in 30 years at Bay Hill, and it was good enough to make a large gallery following Scott forget for a moment that defending champion Tiger Woods was absent because of a back injury.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Andy Bean in 1981 and Greg Norman in 1984 were the only other players with a 62 at Bay Hill.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">After watching Scott make another putt – this one from 20 feet for eagle on No 4 – U.S. Open champion Justin Rose asked if Scott could get to No 1 if he were to win at Bay Hill. The answer: no and yes. He couldn’t overtake Woods this week, but likely would go to No 1 over the next few weeks if neither played.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Scott had reason to be mildly surprised by this round. For one thing, he had not been to Bay Hill in five years. Scott typically plays Innisbrook, but decided to mix it up. And he has some experience on the bag as Steve Williams caddied for Woods in six of the eight Bay Hill wins.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Scott said he was also coping with flu-like symptoms. “Just a bit under the weather,” he said. “I can’t complain.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He is a believer in the adage, “Beware the injured golfer.” He lowered his expectations, focused only on the next shot and was more concerned with his energy than feeling any nerves.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It didn’t take long for him to realise it was going to be a special day, starting with a 20-foot birdie putt on the 10th to start his round. He got up and down from a bunker on the par-5 12th for birdie, made a 25-foot birdie putt on the 14th, and then rolled one in from 30 feet on the 15th from a collection area right of the green.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Scott drilled a 7-iron into 35 feet on the par-5 16th and made that birdie. On the front nine, he hit a pure 3-wood into 20 feet on the par-5 fourth for birdie, and then hit a tough bunker from some 35 yards away to 8 feet for birdie on the par-5 sixth.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It was the sixth time Scott posted a 62 on the U.S. PGA Tour, the most recent at Firestone in 2011, when he won. But he didn’t want to look at it as anything more than just a great start.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Meanwhile, it was reported that Woods is suffering from a bulging disc in his back that will not require surgery.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The 14-time major champion, who is chasing the all-time record 18 majors won by Jack Nicklaus, withdrew on Tuesday due to back spasms from the Arnold Palmer Invitational, his typical warm-up event for the Masters and one that he has won eight times.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">According to a report on the website of Golfweek magazine, which cited an unnamed source, the news was actually better for Woods than if he had suffered a ruptured disc, which likely would have required an operation.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Mark Steinberg, the agent for Woods, told ESPN after the report that “nothing has changed since the announcement on Tuesday,” adding that Woods was resting and would be evaluated again in the next few days.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Woods has never missed the Masters since winning his first major title there in 1997. He was won four green jackets but has not taken the title at Augusta National since 2005.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It’s too early to know about the Masters, and I will continue to be evaluated and work closely with my doctors,” Woods said on Tuesday.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">AP, AFP</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kwLG70a1moKecm3yivtOimqWdX2aBdn%2BXa2porZ6ZsrN51p6YraCVp3q0r86tq2alkamwqbHSZpqoraKosm6%2BxJymq5xdl666eceio6U%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./best-types-of-jackets-coats-women.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="10 Types of Jackets and Coats for Women">&larr;
