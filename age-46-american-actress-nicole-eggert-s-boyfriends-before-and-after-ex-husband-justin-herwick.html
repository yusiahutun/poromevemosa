She has been a little low-profile nowadays but her fans have been willing to know about her personal life. So, let's dig into the life of the famous actress.</p><h2>Baywatch Star Nicole Eggert Married Once; Mother Of Two Children</h2><p>Nicole Elizabeth Eggert aka <a href=# rel=noopener>Nicole Eggert </a>an American actress best known from the movies Charles in Charge as Jamie Powell and everyone's favorite Baywatch as Summer Quinn.</p><p>Well, talking about her personal life, she was engaged to a Canadian actor<strong> Corey Haim</strong>.</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img.marriedwiki.com/uploads/2018/05/ew.jpg alt=nicole style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><strong>Nicole and Corey from the movie Lucas.</strong></p><p><strong>Source: EW</strong></p><p>The former couple met while both were struggling to get in the Hollywood industry and soon found a romantic bond between each other. Eggert said,</p><p>“The first time I met Corey, we were so young, Maybe 14 years old. He had just moved to Los Angeles and had just finished filming ‘Lucas.’”</p><p>Corey had a hard time in the past days as he was a drug addict. Once Eggert helped save Corey life by taking him to the hospital to detox during a narcotic rush. The actor later died from pneumonia on March 10, 2010.</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img.marriedwiki.com/uploads/2018/05/celebrityxyz.jpg alt=nicole style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><strong>Nicole with her husband Justin.</strong></p><p><strong>Source: CelebrityXYZ</strong></p><p>Though several sources claim that Eggert was married to <a href=# rel=noopener>Justin Herwick</a>, in 2000 and got split up in 2002 after two years of marriage, Eggert tweeted that she was never married to Justin.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Tweeters please HELP me & RT! <a href=#>@IMDb</a> my daughter's name is Dilyn Eggert & I was never married to Justin Herwick!!! Get it right please!!!</p>— Nicole Eggert (@NicoleEggert) <a href=#>April 16, 2013</a><p>Well, who knows what was between the two which made her tweet that but the two were seen with each other several times. The couple also shares a daughter <strong>Dilyn Eggert</strong> who was born in 1998. Seems like the actress had some romance before she got married.</p><p>Not only that, Eggert gave birth to her second daughter, <strong>Keegan Eggert</strong> in 2011. She has not yet revealed who the father is. But several sources claim that her ex-husband/boyfriend is Keegan's father.</p><p>Who do you think the father is? Well, hope to hear some hot news about the actress soon enough.</p><h2>Nicole Eggert's Career</h2><p>The actress has been in the acting business for a long time now. Her mother was an agent herself who entered Nicole in a beauty contest when she was 5 which she won eventually.</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img.marriedwiki.com/uploads/2018/05/fhw.jpg alt=nicole style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><strong>Nicole with her two daughters.</strong></p><p><strong>Source: DailyMail</strong></p><p>Right after the contest, she was offered a chance to appear in <a href=# rel=noopener>Johnson's Baby</a>&nbsp;Shampoo commercial. After no time, her film debut came in 1979 where she got a role in the movie When Hell Was in Session.</p><p>She was offered a role in the American&nbsp;drama film,'Rich, and Famous' directed by <strong>George Cukor</strong> in 1981. In the early and mid-80s,&nbsp;she got roles in several movies and TV shows which includes Dennis the Menace in Mayday for Mother, Fantasy Island, The Clan of the Cave Bear.</p><p>Not everyone gets into fame just by doing some shows and movies but she got her big break from the Sitcom, Charles in Charge alongside <strong>Scott Baio</strong> in 1987. She also appeared in the drama series Baywatch as Summer Quinn in the third and fourth seasons of the show as one of the lifeguards of the show.</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img.marriedwiki.com/uploads/2018/05/peoplejbsd.jpg alt=nicole style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><strong>Nicole dressed like on the series Baywatch</strong></p><p><strong>Source: People</strong></p><p>She seemed a little tired of her acting career so she took a break and operated an ice-cream food truck on her own which was a family business according to her.</p><p>The 46-year-old actress has done very well in her career on her own and raised her children by herself which seem to be a hard thing to do alone.</p><h3>Nicole Was Molested Back In Days?</h3><p>The 46-year-old actress was molested by her Charles in Charge co-star Scott Baio. She filed a police report against him recently in February for sexually assaulting her when they worked together.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>TMZ also reports</a> that <strong>Alexander Polinsky</strong> who was on the show with two of them witnessed some of the abusing.</p><p>Baio denied her claims in an interview but confirmed that they did have sex once when Nicole was 18.</p><p>Well, the actress has gone through a lot to be in the place she is in today and let's all appreciate her talent and the work she has done.</p><h2>Quick Facts: Nicole Eggert</h2><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img.marriedwiki.com/uploads/2018/05/411mania.jpg alt=nicole style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><strong>Source: 411Mania</strong></p><ul><li>She was born on January 13, 1972 (age: 46).</li><li>She was born in Glendale, California.</li><li>Her born name is Nicole Elizabeth Eggert.</li><li>She has appeared nude on rock band Sugar Ray's album, Lemonade, and Brownies.</li><li>Her nationality is American.</li><li>Her father's name is Rolf Eggert and mother's name&nbsp;is Gina Eggert.</li><li>Her ethnicity is German-English.</li><li>Her birth sign is Capricorn.</li><li>She stands at a height of 1.6 m.</li></ul><p>Visit <a href=# rel=noopener>Marriedwiki.com/article</a> for interesting news and entertainment!!!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkae%2FqrHDsKCkoV6YvK57wKuropucmnyis8Rma29lkaKys7XCmqVmmZOpv6a%2F0malopufobJuscagnKusXah6o7vYn6minZ6ZwG6uxJ%2Bmq51dlrulecCfq56qXZrFbrTUrJmappRit7a%2F06KlZqCVp8Sqr8o%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./burt-reynolds-massive-ranch-developed-multi-million-dollar-homes-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Burt Reynolds' massive ranch is being developed into multi-million dollar homes">&larr;
