The struggle of getting the precise words to inspire an individual and wishing them well in their new journey is essential. Outlined below are farewell <a id=https://www.legit.ng/1220978-130-romantic-loving-sms.html href=#>message samples</a> that can be sent to coworkers leaving the company.</p><h2>Funny farewell message to coworker</h2><p class=align-left>The following is a list of farewell messages to colleagues leaving the company:</p><ul><li>Are you going away because of the layoff notice you heard will be out soon? But wait, you're not included in the list of mediocre staff that we're weeding out soon. Anyway, the only thing we're going to miss is gossiping together. I wish you good luck and success!</li><li>You must be careful at your new place! Just remember not to do something stupid that will make you end up back here—like what we did at the last Christmas party. I won't be there to have your back at the next place, so keep your eyes peeled. Wishing you all the best!</li><li>I still don't understand why you decided to leave the company. Do you think you can have fun in your new office without us? Okay, let's see who is going to miss what.</li><li>Great to hear that you're going away. I can't wait to hear that you have been crowned as the "gossip queen" at the workplace. See you friend!</li><li>How long do you think it'll take before I accidentally fling Cheerios and paper clips into the next cubicle, thinking that you're still there?</li><li>I wish I could stay with you here, but since I can't, I decided to write you this short note to bid farewell. The only thing I'll miss about you is the latest gossip involving what's going on in the office.</li><li>Second only to deciding to be my friend, moving on up is the best choice you've ever made, your old dog! Let's get beers soon and celebrate this big change.</li><li>Your leaving is the absolute worst. How am I supposed to find another person who is as wonderful to work with as you? You raised the bar too high!</li><li>Clearly, the reason that I'm leaving is so that I don't hinder the chances of those who are due for promotion. But you're aware of the fact that if I stay, the management can't leave me to promote an average coworker like you. Step your game up, and take my job! Bye, mate!</li><li>You're moving away; this office is going nowhere. However, if you need someone to help proofread your work, don't hesitate to contact us. Here's wishing you the best of goodbyes!</li><li>How much more money are they giving you? Write that number down. Double it. Throw the paper away. I don't have that kind of money, but I can bribe you with brownies, my delightful smile, jokes and my friendship. Reconsider staying!</li><li>Now that you've decided to leave the company, the rest of us won't have to pretend to work so hard! We can all chill and relax. Your departure will translate into more money, better job satisfaction, improved job performance and increased productivity for us. Good luck!</li><li>You must have included gossiping as one of your hobbies on your CV to land you a new job. Goodbye, and best of luck in your new endeavour!</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/eb24f4b12a9da5f7.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>100+ sarcastic captions for your Instagram photos and bio</span></p></a><p class=align-left><strong>PAY ATTENTION:</strong> <i>Сheck out news that is picked exactly for YOU ➡️ find “Recommended for you” block on the home page and enjoy!</i></p><h2>Long farewell messages to a colleague</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/eb24f4b12a9da5f7.jpg><p class=align-left>Saying goodbye to coworkers is now easier by using the goodbye quotes for coworkers listed below.</p><ul><li>I know that quitting this job has been one of the best decisions of your life, but it has had the worst impact on your colleagues.
