But for her lifestyle and the time demands of her job, this was the solution that made the most sense for her.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:f9ac1326-ffb6-550d-9cb9-046387348cd6 data-container-ref=toofab:article:d8a58086-5326-5816-b739-e1c60bcf8fc8 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/ab/5by4/2019/06/28/abacb45608325d49b6f7249114de498a_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">YouTube</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Surprise! Shay Mitchell Reveals Pregnancy After 'Months of Hiding'</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>And it's not like she just preemptively decided to do this, either. "I peed myself, I got it a couple good times and I had to throw it out," the actress admitted. â€œBut I'm not doing it. You know, I'm having to pee way too much. It's just like, I'm over it."</p><p>While her stylist was shocked at first, considering she'd had three kids, Mitchell's reasoning proved sound. The stylist even admitted to having had a few accidents herself during her pregnancies. It's unorthodox, it might even seem a little strange, but it's also clearly effective.</p><p>Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.</p><p>The actress first announced her pregnancy on June 28 with an Instagram post of her growing belly and a YouTube video chronicling some of her pregnancy journey so far. The father is "Entertainment Tonight Canada" host Matte Babel, who she's been dating since 2017 and can be seen posing for pregnancy photos with her in the video.</p><p>"I didn't want to come out on social media so early on," she explained at the time. After "months of hiding" her stomach, she added that it's been "a really lonely journey."</p><p>"I think pregnancy is awesome for the most part, but it's also really f--king lonely," she continued. Now, the 32-year-old actress says she's finally feeling "extremely confident ... because I have my baby growing inside me."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:14105984-a044-5471-9365-15addbc7ac3e data-container-ref=toofab:article:d8a58086-5326-5816-b739-e1c60bcf8fc8 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/13/5by4/2019/07/27/13e1b390c10752b880c31b9ee3529c62_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Cardi B Missed Kulture's First Steps, Says Offset Always Witnesses the 'Good S--t'</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>And that confidence has allowed her to open up about one of the more common struggle pregnant women face with a perhaps less common solution she's found that works for her.</p><p>"You can thank me later," Mitchell laughed as she pointed into the camera to her 3.9 million <strong><a href=#>YouTube</a></strong> subscribers. This marks the second episode of "Almost Ready." Mitchell's new bi-weekly YouTube Original Series will chronicle Shay as she "eats for two, continues the endless hunt for non-alcoholic wine and lathers herself in every oil known to man on her journey to motherhood."</p><p>Shay Mitchell is currently filming on her new Hulu series "Dollface" with Kat Dennings, Brenda Song and Esther Povitsky. It's expected to premiere November 15, 2019. While she has not definitively given a due date, Mitchell did talk about how much she'd learned in the past six months in her video suggesting a September or October birth.</p><p><strong>Got a story or a tip for us?
