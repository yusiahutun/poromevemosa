You must believe that the person will eventually change and lead a new and better life.</p><p class=align-left>How do you pray for someone special? When praying, you must believe that God is already working on that person and is guiding them to a brighter life with you. Finally, give God the praise and the glory for the victory over the person's life as if it has already happened.</p><h2 id=307109-can-god-reunite-a-relationship class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>Can God reunite a relationship?</h2><p class=align-left>God can reunite a relationship because He is all-powerful.

Prayer is a powerful way to connect with God and ask for guidance and support for yourself and others. Take some time to sit in stillness and consider who or what you'd like to pray for. Then, begin speaking from your heart, expressing gratitude for the blessings in your life, and making requests for yourself and the person or situation you are praying for.</p><p class=align-left>Reciting a prayer or Psalm to make someone love you without believing it will happen is a waste of time. Before you say prayers for someone you love, have faith and trust in God to turn your request into a reality.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong><a href=#>100+ deepest couple gangster love quotes for him and her</a></p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/42c503161b399cc5.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>100+ sweet love quotes for your fiancé to make him feel loved</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Tuko.co.ke recently published an article containing 100+ deepest couple <a href=#>gangster love quotes</a> for him and her.
