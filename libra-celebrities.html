But the past year has also nudged us to fight for what we believe in and stand up for justice, appreciate simple pleasures and everyday beauty, and value our relationships in a whole new way. These are all lessons that the Libras in your life already knew all too well.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Libra, the seventh sign of the zodiac, is ruled by sweet Venus, which is the planet of love, beauty, and money. Because Venus is associated with socializing and pleasure, those ruled by the planet tend to be people people who prize relationships, art, and all of the things in life that can make us feel like we're glowing from the inside out — from decadent beauty treatments to romantic getaways to heartfelt lovemaking. They're also major fans of old school romance (think: giving or receiving roses and planning an Insta-worthy date night). Cardinal sign Libra are generally born between September 23 and October 22. The air sign, symbolized by the Scales, is also the ruler of the Seventh House of Partnership, so they're wired to be most comfortable moving the ball forward when they're engaging in one-on-one collaborations, whether romantic, platonic, or professional.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Like their fellow air signs, these justice-seeking, community-oriented social butterflies are happiest when they have a schedule packed with travel, parties, or plans with friends, loved ones, colleagues, and clients. (Yup, as you can imagine, they're the signs who've had the toughest time with physical distancing.) And it bears noting that as a cardinal sign, they tend to excel at big picture brainstorming, initiation, and planning as opposed to getting in the tedious weeds of a project.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">There's clearly so much we can learn from the sign of the Scales, under which various beauty-loving, fairness-obsessed, socially-conscious celebs and public figures were born. Consider Libra political superstar Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez aka AOC, who relentlessly goes to bat for an agenda that aims to rebalance power for the American people. Or Brie Larson who didn't only play a female superhero in Captain Marvel but also happens to be a lauded gender equality activist and advocate for sexual assault survivors.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Here, we're honoring some of our favorite Libra celebrities who shine the most when they're socializing and prioritizing serenity, style, romance, justice, and partnership above all else.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Getty Images</span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-1-alexandria-ocasio-cortez></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>1. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Affectionately referred to as AOC, the Democratic Congresswoman from New York's 14th District was born on October 13. Growing up seeing rising income inequality firsthand, the politician was inspired to become an organizer and run on a progressive platform. Her focus on championing the needs of working-class people and advocating for social, racial, economic, and environmental justice is very much in line with her Libra wiring. Plus, Libra's ruling planet Venus is traditionally associated with feminine energy, so it's no surprise AOC quickly became a role model for girls everywhere when she became the youngest woman to ever serve in Congress. She's also a social media maven and style icon who has shared <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>beauty tips</a> and tricks — like the details on her signature red lipstick — on Instagram.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-2-serena-williams></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>2. Serena Williams</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The elite athlete, born on September 26, serves up plenty of Libra-style goals as a style-conscious go-getter. In addition to being a four-time Olympic gold medalist tennis champ, Williams is focused on investing in companies founded by women and minorities and she also launched a self-funded, direct-to-consumer clothing line, S by Serena, in 2018. In true Seventh House of Partnership ruler form, the icon and her husband, Reddit cofounder Alexis Ohanian make for one entrepreneurial power duo. Williams recently talked about how she and husband Alexis Ohanian <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>put a lot of work</a> into their relationship, which tends to come naturally for collaborative, peace-seeking Libras. The tennis star is also an impassioned justice-pursuing activist who famously said at <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Wimbledon in 2019</a>, "The day I stop fighting for equality and for people that look like you and me will be the day I'm in my grave."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-3-dakota-johnson></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>3. Dakota Johnson</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The actor and model, born on October 4, grew up in Hollywood as a result of being the daughter of megastars Don Johnson and Melanie Griffith. It's no wonder she was interested in modeling and acting from a very young age. Now, Johnson has the Fifty Shades of Grey series and a variety of other flicks under her belt, has founded a production company called TeaTime Pictures, and made her directorial debut last year. And when she's not in the spotlight for her work, she's earning accolades for her <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>carefree sense of style</a> or her activism. Johnson famously partnered with Global Citizen to encourage women to share their stories about experiencing sexual harassment, dangerous methods of contraception, or any type of inequality.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Getty Images</span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-4-cardi-b></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>4. Cardi B</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The Grammy-winning songwriter and rapper, born on October 11, has been making waves in both the hip hop universe and fashion world since she performed her hit "Bodak Yellow" wearing $10,000 crystal Saint Laurent boots at the MTV Video Music Awards pre-show in 2017. These days, in addition to making her mark on music in a major way for the past several years, releasing one hit after the next and serving as the face of Balenciaga, the 28-year-old star has been increasingly vocal about political issues. In a sitdown interview with then-candidate Joe Biden, Cardi said, "I want Black people to stop getting killed and no justice for it." Talk about Libra goals.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-5-kim-kardashian></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>5. Kim Kardashian</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The reality star, beauty entrepreneur, and fashionista, born on October 21, exudes Libra vibes. She's a force to be reckoned with as an <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>entrepreneur in the fashion and beauty space</a>, and there's no denying that Kim Kardashian's relationships have been captivating the country for over a decade. Until recently, she was one-half of an air sign duo alongside now ex Kanye West, a Gemini born on June 8, and before that, she was married to another air guy: Aquarius Kris Humphries, born on February 6. But selling perfume and body-sculpting underwear isn't all there is to the Libra powerhouse's professional game. She's also leveraged her Libran sense of what's right and what's wrong to speak out for prison reform and become what the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>New York Times</a> called "a force in criminal justice."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-6-hilary-duff></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>6. Hilary Duff</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Born on September 28, the actor, singer-songwriter, and businesswoman launched her multihyphenate career as a child, starring on the Disney Channel series Lizzie McGuire. She went on to star in films — both mainstream and indie — and executive produce some of the projects she's been in, such as According to Greta and The Haunting of Sharon Tate. And since 2015, she has starred in TV Land's longest-running original series Younger. Duff's love life, weddings, and three children (she just gave birth to a baby girl!) have also been the subject of much publicity. She was married to Mike Comrie from 2010 to 2016 and has been hitched to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Matthew Koma</a> since 2019. And in 2019, she flexed her Venusian business savvy, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>becoming the chief brand officer of Veeda</a>, a company that makes all-natural, cotton-based period products.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Getty Images</span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-7-bella-hadid></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_40-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>7. Bella Hadid</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The model, born on October 9, has garnered attention for being a total fashion star, sister of fellow supermodel Gigi, daughter of Real Housewives' Yolanda Hadid, and girlfriend of The Weeknd. The 24-year-old has also made headlines for her activism, marching against Donald Trump's immigration ban in New York City in 2017 and speaking out about racism in the fashion industry. Last year, she told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>ELLE</a> in true Libra fashion, "I want young girls and boys to know that it is OK to use your voice and demand justice for what is important to you. I want them to know it's OK to be empathetic and gentle, but to be strong and speak your truth at the same time."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-8-gwyneth-paltrow></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_43-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>8. Gwyneth Paltrow</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_44-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The actor and entrepreneur, born on September 27, has never failed to get tongues wagging with her unique taste in baby names, wellness routines, and even breakups. But even the haters can't deny that the cardinal sign goop founder has been a trailblazer in the beauty and lifestyle space, speaking out <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>against environmental toxins</a> and talking about <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>couples' therapy</a> and "conscious uncoupling." The winner of an Academy Award and a Golden Globe Award (both for her very Libran romantic film Shakespeare in Love) and two Emmy Awards, Paltrow is also passionate about activism, working with the Bruce Paltrow Oral Cancer Fund, the Robin Hood Foundation, and Frederique Constant Foundation.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-9-halsey></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_48-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>9. Halsey</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_49-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The singer-songwriter, born Ashley Nicolette Frangipane on September 29, originally leveraged the power of social media to skyrocket to stardom. Gaining attention from her self-released music on social media platforms, she was signed in 2014 and released her first EP later that year. To date, she's won four Billboard Music Awards, one American Music Award, one GLAAD Media Award, an MTV Video Music Award, and two Grammy Award nominations, and she was included on Time magazine's annual list of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2020. The pop star has also channeled her Libra powers toward suicide prevention awareness, sexual assault victim advocacy, and racial justice protests. She's also reportedly proud to have been born under the air sign, sporting a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Lil Wayne-designed tattoo</a> that's an image of the scales surrounded by the words "sins" and "forgiveness."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_51-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Getty Images</span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-10-brie-larson></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_52-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>10. Brie Larson</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_53-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The Oscar, Golden Globe, and Emmy award-winning Captain Marvel and Room star, born on October 1, has been called <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>"unabashedly earnest,"</a> which is illustrated in her advocacy. As a Venus-ruled justice fighter, Larson was involved early on in Time's Up, championing the voices of sexual assault survivors and speaking out about how Hollywood portrays women and a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>bevy of other inequalities</a> in the industry. It's no wonder colleague Tessa Thompson said Larson's "activism is an extension of who she is." She's also known for making quite the impression on the red carpet as a Libra beauty and style icon who is the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>brand muse</a> for Japanese luxury beauty company Decorté.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-11-naomi-watts></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_55-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>11. Naomi Watts</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_56-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Born on September 28, the British actor and film producer became an international sensation after starring in David Lynch's psychological thriller Mulholland Drive in 2001 and then the horror remake The Ring in 2002. Over the past couple of decades, she has starred in a variety of critically-acclaimed flicks, such as 21 Grams, The Impossible, and St. Vincent. The 52-year-old Libra movie star is also a fan of clean beauty, previously explaining to InStyle, "I've always liked the idea of going for more natural products, but I think now is the time where people are more conscious of what is going into the products they're using. I think at my age, you want to be able to do nice things for yourself. It's not just about eating well and exercising, but also what you're applying to your skin since it does get absorbed." She's also involved in philanthropic work, serving as an ambassador for UNAIDS, the United Nations organization fighting the spread of HIV and AIDS.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-12-gwen-stefani></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_58-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>12. Gwen Stefani</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_59-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Initially bursting onto the ska and alternative rock scene as the frontwoman — as well as co-founder, lead vocalist, and the primary songwriter — of No Doubt in 1995, Stefani, born on October 3, has continued to find international success as a solo artist, fashion designer who founded her line L.A.M.B. in 2003, and The Voice coach. Of course, her relationships — first, her marriage to Bush's Gavin Rossdale and now, her partnership with country star Blake Shelton — have captivated the public, too. Known for her signature, bold style, Stefani has made an impression in everything from punk rock combat boots to Harajuku-inspired looks and retro Hollywood designs. Stefani, who has said that she's a Libra who's "all about balance," has also received applause for using her platform for good, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>speaking out against racism</a> and championing the statement "love is love."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57y6Kdnqukrrmme8Csq6unnKS0unvLopmrmV2Ysq2xwaugraGVqA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./valentines-day-outfit-ideas-8409205.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="8 Valentine's Day Outfit Ideas Fashion Stylists Love">&larr;
