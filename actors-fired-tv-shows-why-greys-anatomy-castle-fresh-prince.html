Explaining what happened in Lynette Rice's book,&nbsp;How to Save a Life: The Inside Story of Grey's Anatomy, writer Harry Workman explained: "[Isaiah] went after Patrick, pushed him up against the wall, and said, 'You can't talk to me the way you talk to that little [expletive] T.R [Knight].'"</p><p id=eB8iKtCCiXsx data-wc=1><strong>MORE:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>Grey's Anatomy stars' chic homes: Ellen Pompeo, Patrick Dempsey and more</a></strong></p><p id=e0t2Rj4MJ7Uj data-wc=32>Crew member Marty Carrillo added:&nbsp;"Everyone knew T.R. was gay. ..

Speaking about the firing in the book, Isaiah wrote: "I can apologize only so many times. I can accept only so much responsibility. I just hope people in the industry can understand that it’s a horrible misunderstanding, what transpired with our show, and it was blown out of proportion."&nbsp;</p><h2>Janet Hubert - The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air&nbsp;</h2><p id=eyPly9TI0NHt data-wc=115>Janet was recast as Aunt Viv on the popular show but denies that she was fired. Speaking in the HBO special, she said: "During that third season when I got pregnant, there were a lot of things going on in my life, and in Will’s life as well… They offered me this really bad deal in the third season… So that meant my salary was cut… So I said, ‘No.’ I did not accept their offer. I was never fired, so the misconception was always put out there. I was trapped, what could I do? So they said, ‘Okay, we’re gonna recast your role.’ And I said…what could I say? I was hurt deeply.
