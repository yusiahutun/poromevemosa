Those dreaded pimples, clogged pores, and blemishes can wreak havoc on your skincare game. But don’t stress — with the best The Ordinary products for acne-prone skin, you can get your skin health back on track. We have handpicked toners, serums, masques, and emollients for you that just work! As you go through our list, you will find a lot of moisturizing and hydrating ingredients and products, instead of harsh exfoliants.&nbsp;</p><p>As an acne sufferer, you may think moisturizing will make oily skin worse. Not true! Let us explain. Your skin makes excess oil when it's dehydrated — another reason why even dry-skin folks break out and get acne flares. Properly hydrating the skin can actually help regulate oil production and prevent breakouts, as per<a href=#><u> a study published on NCBI</u></a>. A good moisturizer doesn’t add oil, rather it helps the skin retain water. Humectants like hyaluronic acid pull water into the outer skin layers, while emollients seal it in. Over time, the right moisturizing agents will help balance your skin.</p><p>The Ordinary's formulas feature proven acne-fighting and hydrating ingredients like <a href=#><u>salicylic acid</u></a>, kaolin clay, glycolic acid, retinol, and azelaic acid. Plus, all the products in their line are clinically tested, cruelty-free, and vegan! So give your skin the affordably luxurious hydration and care it needs, and wave goodbye to acne. With their affordably priced, high-quality products, The Ordinary has your back and we are here to help you find the best picks from their assortment. Read on.</p><p>Our top picks</p><p><h2 class=title>Best The Ordinary Products for Acne</h2></p><p>This Retinol 1% Serum by The Ordinary is like a time machine for your face, restoring a youthful glow without irritation. It not only helps minimize signs of aging like fine lines and wrinkles but also reduces acne and inflamed skin! As <a href=#><u>this study published in NCBI</u></a> suggests, retinol can cleanse out and dissolve comedones (acne) and help minimize or resolve flare-ups with its anti-inflammatory properties.&nbsp;</p><p>As evident from the product title, the star ingredient is 1% pure retinol, a skincare superhero that smooths fine lines and evens out skin tone and texture. But retinol can be drying, so The Ordinary wisely added squalane, a hydrating agent that mimics your skin's natural oils.</p><p>We love how this serum feels rich yet quickly absorbs without oiliness to make skin look plumper and more radiant after just a few uses. The dropper bottle makes application a breeze. And the price is delightfully affordable.</p><p><strong>Key Ingredients:</strong> Squalene, 1% retinol, jojoba seed oil</p><p><strong>Size:</strong> 30 ml/1 Fl oz</p><p>Pros</p><ul class=pros_list><li>Suits all skin types</li><li>Lightweight</li><li>Quick absorbing</li><li>Dark bottle for product longevity</li><li>Affordably priced</li><li>Anti-aging properties</li></ul><p>Cons</p><ul class=cons_list><li>May not suit beginner retinol users</li></ul><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.pinkvilla.com/assets/select/images/quick_tip_bulb_icon.png alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><h2 class=exp-tip--head--style>Quick Tip:</h2><p class=exp--tip--content>If you're new to retinol, start with a lower percentage formula like 0.2% or 0.5% retinol and work your way up.

That’s not all it does though. As supported by a <a href=#><u>study published in NCBI</u></a>, hyaluronic acid also helps regulate sebum production.

What’s impressive? The squalene is derived from sugar cane, so it's sustainably sourced.&nbsp;</p><p>On a side note, while squalene can be an excellent choice for deep moisturizing oily skin due to its non-comedogenic, bioidentical, and lightweight nature, we do advise using it with caution. If you have dry skin though, go right ahead and use it to your skin’s content.

Just a few swipes of a saturated cotton pad, and you'll feel it working its magic to smooth pesky bumps, brighten dull skin, fade dark spots, and balance out uneven skin tone. But that’s not why we chose it for acne-prone skin types. We picked it because glycolic acid is very effective at dissolving clogged pores, reducing acne and redness, and improving the appearance of acne scars, even in low concentrations, as shown in this <a href=#><u>study published in the Journal of Cosmetic Dermatology</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>What we like the most about this one is that unlike some harsh acid toners out there, this toning solution is surprisingly gentle thanks to the addition of Tasmanian pepper berry, which soothes as it exfoliates. So you get all the amazing benefits of an acid toner without the red, stinging skin. Pick this to treat your skin into a flawless and glowing complexion!&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Key Ingredients:</strong> Glycolic acid, aloe barbadensis leaf water, panax ginseng root extract, Tasmannia lanceolata fruit/leaf extract</p><p><strong>Size</strong>: 240ml/ 8 Fl oz</p><p>Pros</p><ul class=pros_list><li>Great for people with oily skin types</li><li>Suitable for combination skin</li><li>Brightening effect on skin</li><li>Makes skin soft</li><li>Affordable price point</li><li>Gentle</li></ul><p>Cons</p><ul class=cons_list><li>Needs careful application and patch test before use</li><li>May not work for fungal acne</li></ul><p><h2 class=title>How to Pick the Best the Ordinary Products for Acne?</h2></p><p><strong>Skin Type And Concern</strong></p><p>Before picking your The Ordinary product for acne issues, it is important to understand your skin concerns as that will help you determine what kind of product you need. If you are dealing with rough texture and blemishes from past acne, something like <a href=#><u>The Ordinary Glycolic Acid 7% Toning Solution </u></a>can help. If you want a product to meet your skin’s moisturization needs without triggering breakouts, then you can pick hydrating serums and emollients. Overall, pick the product that can help you meet your skin’s most pressing needs first. Also, check if the product is suited for your skin type.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Formulation And Ingredients&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Check the active/key ingredients in products you like and analyze whether they can suit your skincare goals before picking a product. Salicylic acid is a wonder ingredient for oily and acne-prone skin whereas hyaluronic acid can do wonders for dry and dehydrated skin. Also, be mindful of strong ingredients like acids or retinoids and check the strength — and whether it will suit your skin — before you take your pick.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>Simplify your routine with The Ordinary’s no-fuss formulas that come as clean and transparent as it gets! We have shortlisted the products that work to not only minimize acne but also restore the skin barrier and help heal your skin from the inside out.
