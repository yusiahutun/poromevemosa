However, she never provided any additional information about her birth date. This limited information about her birthday and zodiac sign.</p><h2><span id=Family_Litzi_Botello>Family Litzi Botello</span></h2><p>Litzi Botello was born to Tia Botello and an unnamed husband. She frequently posted pictures of her parents on Facebook. Her Facebook friends noted that she is a carbon copy of her mother.</p><p>Litzi clearly values her relationship with her parents, but she intends to keep everything about them private. According to one of the comments on her parent’s photo, her mother has died. That’s about all we know about her parents.</p><p>Litzi has at least one sibling, a sister named Jessica Botello, according to her family history.</p><h2><span id=Her_Height_and_Weight>Her Height and Weight</span></h2><p>She is aging to be a very beautiful lady, with her long still-colored dark hair and the kindest face a person can have. The contrast between her fair skin and the black color makes her look very attractive.</p><p><strong>Litzi Botello is also quite tall, standing at 5 feet 5 inches (1.65 meters). She also weighed nearly 68 kilograms (149 lbs).</strong></p><h2><span id=What_Became_of_Litzi_Botello8217s_Arm>What Became of Litzi Botello’s Arm?</span></h2><p>If you’re here because you saw Port Protection, you may have noticed that Litzi Botello is a one-armed lady. But she never felt compelled to explain what had happened to her arm.</p><p>But Litzi isn’t discouraged because she only has one arm. She frequently boasted, both on and off the show, about being able to do anything two-handed people can do. She is not wrong at all based on how she has survived in the wilderness of Alaska.</p><h2><span id=Is_she_active_on_Instagram>Is she active on Instagram?</span></h2><p>To cut a long story short, Litzi does not appear to be on Instagram. She is, however, on Facebook, where she frequently posts. She demonstrated her love and affection for her family. Her two sons and husband were also featured on her Facebook page.</p><p>Litzi was on Facebook on January 27, 2021, and she posted a photo of her two sons.</p><h2><span id=What_is_the_Net_Worth_of_Litzi_Botello_Salary_Earnings>What is the Net Worth of Litzi Botello?

She hasn’t provided much to Port Protection fans as an individual with a private nature. But surviving in Alaska is not easy, and she does it with ease and has been doing it for nearly 40 years.</p><p>This simply meant that Litzi is well-prepared to survive in a community of only 100 people. She has been featured in print media as well as on National Geographic’s Port Protection.</p><p>When two small schools in Southeast Alaska were closed, Litzi was interviewed by the Anchorage Daily News. She reminisced about her hometown years ago. She also mentioned that the school served as a hub for events such as Thanksgiving, basketball games, the annual bazaar, and many others.</p><p>Litzi enjoys arts and crafts on a separate page. She also creates stunning Fimo arts. She also used Fimo clay to make fish, ravens, and a few other things. Litzi Botello’s husband’s name is Litzi Botello. Litzi Botello met her husband, John Bean, in her early twenties, according to Distractify. Soon after they married, the couple relocated to Alaska and settled down. He worked as a fisherman by trade.</p><p>Litzi and her husband did an excellent job raising their children. They spent the majority of their married life happily married in Alaska.</p><p>More information on her husband: John Sutherland Bean was born to Robert Sutherland Bean and Diane Bean. During World War II, his grandfather, George Bean, was a Motor Mechanist’s Mate in the United States Navy and served in the Philippines. He grew up in a large family with five siblings.</p><h2><span id=What_Became_of_Litzi_Botello_Sons>What Became of Litzi Botello Sons?</span></h2><p>Litzi Botello and John had two children: Jhonny Duarte Botello and Leland Caulder Botello Bean. His eldest son, Leland, was born on June 26, 1991, and her youngest son, Jhonny, was born on June 28, 1996.</p><p>But Litzi understands what it’s like to lose a child to an unnatural cause. She had to deal with that unfortunate event when her eldest son, Leland, died on July 10, 2017. However, the cause of Leland’s death remains unknown.</p><p>However, Litzi’s second son, Jhonny, died in a car accident with a logging truck. He sustained a brain injury, multiple fractures to his left femur, a jaw fracture, and numerous scrapes and abrasions.</p><p>Jhonny was also placed in a medically induced coma so that doctors could perform a Cerebral Angiogram to determine the extent of brain injury. He graduated as a college valedictorian in 2014. He also had carpentry skills and was hired as a full-time employee.</p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Read More: </span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400>Tamra Judge</span></a><span style=font-weight:400>, </span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400>Cora Gauthier</span></a><span style=font-weight:400>, </span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400>Sophia Florsch</span></a><span style=font-weight:400>,</span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400> Erica Duarte</span></a></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Celebrity</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Summer Warne</a></h3>Summer Warne- Biography Summer Warne is already a well-known celebrity, and people have been curious about her, but now the entire world is looking for her.
