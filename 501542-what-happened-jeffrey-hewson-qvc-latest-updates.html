Here are some interesting facts about him:</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/82b5f01f849ad3aa.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Jamal Rohosafi: Inside Former Matatu Tout's KSh 28 Million Car Collection</span></p></a><h3>1. Jeffrey once worked as a weatherman</h3><p class=align-left>Jeffrey Hewson was born in Dayton, Ohio, on August 5, 1951, and grew up raised nearby Franklin. Prior to joining QVC, he worked as a radio <a href=#>disc jockey</a> and TV weatherman in Dayton.</p><p class=align-left>Then, in 1983, he moved to Pennsylvania to work for a local restaurant, where he discovered a local cable network QVC. He saw an opening for an on-air presenter and applied, and after a few auditions, he landed the job. It was the start of a remarkable career that would make him a household name across the United States.</p><h3>2. He became a QVC host in 1986</h3><p class=align-left>Jeffrey became a QVC host in 1986, becoming one of its most iconic TV presenters. His charming personality and quick wit made him bond closely with his audiences. In addition, he was renowned for his demonstrations of products, some of which were slightly absurd.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/38cf268c3dd6c167.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Who is Sarah Everard's partner?

Another time, he sold a 3,200-pound cheese wheel, much to the delight of viewers.</p><h3>3. The personality married co-anchor Judy Crowell</h3><p class=align-left>In April 1992, Jeffrey Hewson tied the knot with her then-QVC TV co-host<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> Judy Crowell</a>. Although the two were worked on two different segments on the station, they clicked, and a romance developed after that. The two wedded in a colourful ceremony attended by then <a href=#>family</a> and friends.</p><h3>4. His marriage lasted for three months</h3><p class=align-left>Three months into her marriage, things hit the fan. Jeffrey and Judy filed for divorce, citing<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> irreconcilable issues</a> for the split. Media speculations allege that Hewson had asked for a divorce from Judy right before she went on air. The whole episode left her emotionally distressed and shaken, citing infidelity as the route reason for divorce.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/351909a85cd536df.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Ben Francis: Man Who Dropped out Of University to Make Gym Leggings Named UK's Youngest Billionaire</span></p></a><h2>What happened to Jeffrey Hewson on QVC?</h2><p class=align-left>He disappeared from the screen, making viewers wonder what had happened to their favourite host. Rumours started circulating that he was no longer with the network, but QVC provided no clarifications.</p><p class=align-left>The silence from QVC added to the mystery surrounding his departure. In a 2017 interview with the New York Times, former QVC colleague Lisa Robertson shed some light on the situation. Lisa revealed that Jeffrey had suffered a stroke, which left him partially paralysed and unable to continue working at QVC.</p><p class=align-left>Jeffrey's suffered a stroke right around the time anchor Lisa Roberston joined QVC, and she saw him struggle to recover. She recalled how he had to re-learn how to speak and walk. So where is Jeffrey Hewsen? After some time, he chose to retire and left the state of Pennsylvania, where QVC is headquartered.</p><p class=align-left>Jeffrey Hewson is an iconic salesman, and his story perfectly exemplifies his fall from fate to grace.
