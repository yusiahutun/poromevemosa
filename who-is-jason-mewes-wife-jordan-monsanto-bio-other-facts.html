It is therefore something to be happy about when someone seeks help and embarks on the odious journey towards a non-addictive lifestyle. This action serves not only as encouragement but also as an example for younger people who want to free themselves from drug addiction. Jason Mewes is a talented American television and film actor who also works as an Internet radio host and film producer. He played an iconic role in a film that has since become a mainstay. However, Jason Mewes did not always have an easy and smooth life.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Who is Jason Mewes? Bio</strong></h2><p>Jason was born on June 12, 1974, in Highlands, New Jersey. Jason never met his father, and his mother was an ex-convict and drug addict. He grew up in a working-class neighborhood, and his full birth name is Jason Edward Mewes. Jason remembers how extreme the situation was with his mother and tells how she checked into hotels and picked up their TVs, which she sold for money. He also added that she also stole mail.</p><p>Mewes had been exposed to drugs at a very young age, and since his mother’s condition made him hostile to drugs, he would later walk down the same slippery slope. However, as his best friend and later filmmaker Kevin Smith told us, Jason had been a fun and uncomplicated person from a very young age.</p><p><strong>ALOS READ: <a href=#>Bill Goldberg Bio, Wife, Son, Family, Age, Height, Weight, Net Worth</a></strong></p><p>Kevin Smith let Mewes make his film debut as Jay in his 1994 film Clerks. At that time Mewes earned his living by tiling the roof. Although it was a low-budget film, it became a great success and Mewes was often asked to play the leading role in future productions.</p><p>Since then, Mewes has starred in a variety of roles: Mallrats (1995), Chasing Amy (1997), Dogma (1999), Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back (2001), and sequels to some of his earlier films. Mewes and Kevin have always worked closely together in films such as Scream 3, Bottoms Up and the Canadian television series Degrassi: The Next Generation. Kevin and Mewes both host a weekly podcast called Jay & Silent Bob Get Old, in which Mewes talks about his drug addiction.</p><p>Although Mewes enjoyed some success at the beginning of his career, he also suffered from a drug addiction problem. He only started using heroin after high school, after performing with Mallrats. During the shooting of “Chasing Amy and Dogma,” Mewes was under the influence of heroin. After he was taken to rehab by Kevin, he sobered up but soon relapsed after finding a way to beat the urine tests.</p><p>His mother was diagnosed with AIDS, and Jason Mewes moved in with her while he tried to get clean. He was arrested in New Jersey in 1999 for heroin possession. He failed to appear in court in 2001, and a warrant was issued for his arrest. During this time, his friend Kevin Smith reimbursed him for the cost of rehab and even took him in. Mewes was evicted when he was caught using drugs again. He had also stolen Smith’s ATM card and charged $1,100 for heroin use. Kevin refused to give him a part in Jersey Girl from 2004. He came around the corner when he woke up on Christmas morning in 2003 and saw his couch being lit by a burning candle. He stayed clean for a few years, relapsed in 2009 after surgery, but has been clean again since 2010.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Wife – Jordan Monsanto</strong></h2><p>Jason Mewes is married to film producer Jordan Monsanto. The couple co-produced the cartoon film “Jay & Silent Bob’s Super Groovy Cartoon Movie” in 2013. The couple married on January 30, 2009, and Mewes and Jordan welcomed their daughter, Logan Lee, on April 1, 2015.</p><p><strong>ALOS READ: <a href=#>Who Is John Brown Of NFL?
