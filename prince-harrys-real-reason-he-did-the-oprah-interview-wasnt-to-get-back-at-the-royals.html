Although many theories have sparked since the bombshell interview, only Prince Harry and Meghan know why they did Oprah, even it others think they do have an inkling.</strong></p><p>The 39-year-old actually opened up again not long after the special came out March 7, 2021, and explained his reason by the big decision. In May of that year, his next <a href=#>TV</a> show with Apple, The Me You Can’t See, landed on the streaming service. Only two months after the bombshell interview with Oprah, <a href=#>Prince Harry</a> revealed in detail why he did Oprah alongside his wife – and no, it had nothing to do with The Firm or the rift with his brother.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-prince-harry-explained-why-he-did-oprah>Prince Harry explained why he did Oprah</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-04-at-16.37.34-1024x525.png><p>The series, which focused on mental health, was actually in the works before the <a href=#>Oprah interview came out</a>. But with scheduling conflicts, plans for projects and editing, it arrived in May.</p><p>At this point, <a href=#>Meghan Markle</a> and Harry had been away from the UK for more than a year. They had found their forever home at their <a href=#>Montecito mansion</a> with their son, and was waiting for their daughter to arrive. They were truly building their happily ever after. Quite fitting, especially how <a href=#>Harry said Meghan was just like Cinderella</a> on their first date.</p><p>Seeing as the entire premise of the show was speaking out on mental <a href=#>health</a>, to destroy the stigma surrounding the topic, the now 39-year-old opened up a lot.</p><p>And at one point Prince Harry explained why he <a href=#>agreed to speak to Oprah</a>, and shut down any rumors it was only what Meghan wanted to do.</p><p>He said: “I like to think that we were able to speak truth in the most compassionate way possible, therefore leaving an opening for reconciliation and healing.</p><p>“The interview was about being real, being authentic, and hopefully sharing an experience that we know is incredibly relatable around the world, despite our unique privileged position.”</p><p>The Sussexes wanted to tell their side of the story since their relationship went public. After <a href=#>meeting over Instagram DMs</a>, their whirlwind romance enjoyed a few months before the <a href=#>celebrity couple</a> was public.</p><p>Even if <a href=#>Harry invited Meghan back to his place</a> on their first date and she turned him down – their love story was written in the stars. Because six years after tying the knot in 2018 in <a href=#>their royal wedding</a>, they’re still going strong.</p><p>Every new photo, project and statement they make is proving they’re stronger together. It also sends a message to trolls who claim their marriage will only last <a href=#>‘years and not decades’</a>.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-it-came-with-a-price>It came with a price</h2><p>Despite wanting to put themselves out there, the problem is you open yourself up to more criticism.</p><p>The couple had said they wanted more privacy and then spoke about private conversations behind closed doors. This didn’t exactly go down well with some fans of The Firm, as well as experts who couldn’t wrap their head around the juxtoposition.</p><p>After it was announced, it made headlines. Of course it would. Especially how CBS framed the teasers. The production company Prince Harry and Meghan signed up to when they went to do Oprah knew what they needed to do to make it sell.</p><p>Think about the trailer where <a href=#>celebrity</a> Oprah says: “Were you silent, or were you silenced?”</p><p>Cut to Meghan. Fade to black. Intense music.</p><p>It’s <a href=#>Hollywood</a> gold.</p><p><strong>If you are affected by any issues raised in the article or would like someone to speak to, please call the Samaritans for free on 116 123.

That’s heartbreaking. I held her, we talked, she cried and she cried and she cried.”</p><p>He also opened up over feeling “ashamed” he couldn’t help her when she had suicidal thoughts when pregnant with Archie.</p><p>The dad-of-two admitted: “I’m somewhat ashamed of the way that I dealt with it… When my wife and I were in those chairs gripping each other’s hand the moment the lights go down, Meghan starts crying, I’m feeling sorry for her but I’m also really angry with myself that we’re stuck in this situation.</p><p id=eSIgc4lpqCjs>“I was ashamed that it got this bad. I was ashamed to go to my family because to be honest with you like a lot of other people my age could probably relate to, I know that I’m not going to get from my family what I need.”</p><p>The <a href=#>Suits</a> star was praised by charities for opening up over her mental health during the interview.</p><p>Prince Harry has been an outspoken advocate for mental health, which is probably another reason why he did Oprah even if in the back of his mind he wasn’t sure if it was the right thing to do. Purely, because of the backlash of trolls and online reports.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlrX2WEcLzRoqWcnV2drrO%2B2Kxkq52RoXqzscCspqdlmJp6pbXDZquhnV2kvbOtx2agp6yVp8OqsdZmrpqrnql6tbuMoJytZZKWsKx5wK1kraCVYr%2BwxcClqmg%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./quiet-luxury-brands.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The best quiet luxury brands to know in 2023">&larr;
