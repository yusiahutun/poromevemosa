I rejoiced greatly to find some of your children walking in the truth, just as the father commanded us. And now I ask you, dear lady—not as though I were writing you a new commandment, but the one we have had from the beginning—that we love one another.</li><li>1 Peter 5:2-4: Shepherd the flock of God that is among you, exercising oversight, not under compulsion, but willingly, as God would have you; not for shameful gain, but eagerly; not domineering over those in your charge, but being examples to the flock.

For in these things, I delight, declares the Lord.</li><li>Deuteronomy 8:2–3: And you shall remember that the Lord your God has led you these forty years in the wilderness, that he might humble you, testing you to know what was in your heart, whether you would keep his commandments or not. And he humbled you and let you hunger and fed you with manna, which you did not know, nor did your fathers know, that he might make you see that man does not live by bread alone, but man lives by every word that comes from the mouth of the Lord.</li><li>Isaiah 57:15: For thus saith the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity, whose name is Holy; I dwell in the high and holy place, with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones.</li><li>Job 22:29: When cast down, you will speak confidently, and He will save the humble person.</li><li>Luke 14:11: For whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted.</li><li>Obadiah 1:3,4: The pride of your heart has deceived you, you who dwell in the clefts of the rock, whose habitation is high; You who say in your heart, ‘Who will bring me down to the ground?’ Though you ascend as high as the eagle and set your nest among the stars, I will bring you down from there.</li><li>Proverbs 11:12: When pride comes, then comes disgrace, but with humility comes wisdom.</li><li>Proverbs 15:33: Wisdom’s instruction is to fear the Lord, and humility comes before honour.</li><li>James 1:9-10: Believers in humble circumstances ought to take pride in their high position. But the rich should take pride in their humiliation—since they will pass away like a wild flower.</li><li>John 3:30: He must become greater; I must become less.</li><li>Galatians 5:13: You, my brothers and sisters, were called to be free. But do not use your freedom to indulge the flesh; instead, serve one another humbly in love.</li><li>Colossians 3:12: Therefore, as God’s chosen people, holy and dearly loved, clothe yourselves with compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness and patience.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/81f3937d84e4379c.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Sermon for students preparing for exams to encourage and motivate them</span></p></a><h2 id=546035-what-is-true-humility-according-to-the-bible class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>What is true humility according to the Bible?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/db1c36d44c64f088.png><p class=align-left>Why is humility important to God?
