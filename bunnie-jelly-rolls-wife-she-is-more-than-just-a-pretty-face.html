Discover the woman behind the ‘crazy.’</strong></p><p>Bunnie Xo and popular music artist Jelly Roll are two individuals who create a crazy spark. Their chemistry made fans super excited and glued to their lives.&nbsp;</p><p>Jelly Roll largely attributes his success in the country rap music industry to Bunnie, whom he greatly appreciates. The accolades given to Bunnie by Jelly Roll made her appear different from her crazy online personality.</p><p>It also made many wonder if there is more to Bunnie, Jelly Roll’s wife, than meets the eye.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Is_Bunnie_Jelly_Rolls_Wife></span>Who Is Bunnie, Jelly Roll’s Wife?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Bunnie DeFord, also known as Bunny Xo, is a well-known figure in the entertainment industry. She gained popularity as the wife of the famous American rapper Jelly Roll. Bunnie was born on January 22, 1995, in Nashville, Tennessee. Her father, Bill Spills, raised her as a single parent.</p><p>Bunnie might have grown up with a non-celebrity parent, but she has done much for herself and takes pride in her achievements. She is not only a model and an Instagram sensation but also the owner of Dumb Blonde Productions and a podcast host. Bunnie has appeared in Jelly Roll’s music videos and concerts, proving she is a supportive partner.</p><p>Bunnie’s beauty and youthfulness do not reflect her age, and she works hard to maintain her appearance. Although she was born Bunny Xo, she changed her surname to DeFord after marrying Jelly Roll.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Jelly-Rolls-wife.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Beneath_the_Crazy_Bunnie_Jelly_Rolls_Wife_Is_a_Darling></span>Beneath the Crazy, Bunnie, Jelly Roll’s Wife, Is a Darling<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Bunnie’s appearance sometimes appears too ‘crazy,’ but she has proven to be a darling. Bunnie Xo has been Jelly Roll’s constant companion and rock, supporting him throughout his music career. Their teamwork finally paid off at the 2023 CMT Awards, where Jelly Roll performed and had three nominations for his hit single “Son of a Sinner.”</p><p>He was nominated for Male Video of the Year, Male Breakthrough Video of the Year, and CMT Digital-First Performance of the Year. Jelly Roll openly expressed his appreciation for Bunnie, describing her as his best friend and crediting her for helping him get his music career off the ground.</p><p>But Bunnie’s role in Jelly Roll’s life extends beyond being a supportive partner. She has also played a significant role in raising Jelly Roll’s daughter, Bailee Ann DeFord. Jelly Roll acknowledges that it takes a selfless person to help raise a child they didn’t give birth to, and he is grateful for Bunnie’s dedication and love for their family.</p><p>The rapper has two children from his previous relationships, Bailee, born in 2008, and Noah Buddy DeFord, born in 2016.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_Did_Jelly_Roll_Meet_His_Wife_Bunnie_Xo></span>How Did Jelly Roll Meet His Wife, Bunnie Xo<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Bunnie Xo and Jelly Roll’s love story began at a concert in 2010, where Jelly Roll was performing at the Las Vegas Country Saloon. Although the couple crossed paths, Bunnie did not recognize Jelly Roll then. Contrary to what Jelly Roll jokes about, they did not meet at a plus-size male strip club where he worked as a stripper.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Capture3-3.png><p>After six and a half years, Bunnie and Jelly Roll married on August 31, 2016. They have stayed together despite their busy schedules and remain in love. The couple’s “weirdness” works well together, as demonstrated in an adorable video at a wedding, where they vibed off each other. Bunnie <a href=#>captioned</a> the clip, “Find someone who matches your weird.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_Does_Jelly_Rolls_Wife_Do_for_a_Living></span>What Does Jelly Roll’s Wife Do for a Living<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>With years of experience, Bunnie has become a household name as the founder of Dumb Blonde Productions. She is also a captivating podcast host, a model, and an Instagram sensation with a whopping 900k followers.</p><p>Despite being a high school dropout, Bunnie has come a long way since her YouTube debut. Her podcast, “The Dumb Blonde,” has gained a massive following with over 100,000 views. Through her podcast, she brings to light the struggles and triumphs of various individuals. She has also appeared in music records alongside famous artists like JaViking Barbie.</p><p>Bunnie’s success story is not limited to just podcasting and modeling. In an interview, she revealed that she stumbled upon OnlyFans, which has become her primary source of income. The hard work and dedication of Bunnie, Jelly Roll’s wife, have paid off. Her net worth is estimated to be $2.5 million in 2023, and more growth is expected due to her exciting new partnerships.</p><p>Beautiful love stories like Bunnie and Jelly Roll are not uncommon among celebrities. Actor <a href=#>John Travolta</a> and his wife, Kelly Preston, were together for 28 years until she died in 2020.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51kr7a6zaKcZqKVobm6edGoo6WrXay2p7GMrJ%2BeZZmoeq670Z5kraCRo3qrwdKtZJploKeytcDYZp2am5Vk</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./sebastian-shakespeare-forgiveness-grave-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="SEBASTIAN SHAKESPEARE: Forgiveness from beyond the grave">&larr;
