They share one child together, daughter Sabine. Holmes is also the father of two children, daughter Brianna and son Jaidan, from his marriage to ex-wife, Amy Ferson. In an essay for <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">The Root</a> in 2014 in honor of his and Fiebig’s four-year wedding anniversary, Holmes wrote about how he became a better person as a result of his marriage to Fiebig.&nbsp;“I, like many other men, thought that I wanted to reach a certain level of success before marriage. You know, make the right amount of money, get the right job, the right car, the right crib, etc., and perhaps ‘sow the royal oats,'” he wrote at the time. “Now, I firmly believe the success we seek can come a lot quicker with a partner helping along the way. Believe me, my ego is as big as anyone’s, but recognizing my own deficiencies, admitting to myself that I need help and accepting that help have all been critical to our success. We’re only on year No. 4, but I shudder to think of the kind of man I might be if I wasn’t married these past four years.”</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Amy-Robach-TJ-Holmes.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/TJ-Holmes-Marilee-Fiebig.jpg><p>After more than 11 years of marriage, reports came out in November 2022 that <a href=# rel=noopener>Holmes had cheated on Fiebig</a> with his Good Morning America co-host, <a href=# rel=noopener>Amy Robach</a>. A source told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Page Six</a> at the time that Holmes and Robach (who is married to actor Andrew Shue) left their spouses in August 2022 and started their affair in 2022 after they began training together for the New York City Marathon, which they ran together three weeks before their alleged relationship became public. A source told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">People</a> at the time, however, that rumors of Holmes and Robach’s affair started long before they started training for the New York City Marathon. “There were rumors they were having an affair about a year ago,” the source said. “A lot of people believed there might have been some truth to it, because you can see there’s a mutual affection there. But everyone ultimately chalked it up to friendship because they always said they were both happily married.</p><p>But back to <a href=# id=auto-tag_tj-holmes data-tag=tj-holmes>TJ Holmes</a>‘ wife.

Fiebig broke her silence on Holmes and Robach’s affair in a statement to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">The Daily Mail</a> on January 4, 2022. “During the holiday season and in light of the challenging times, Marilee’s sole focus has remained on the overall best interest of her 9-year-old daughter,” Fiebig’s attorney Stephanie Lehman said in a statement at the time. “To that end T.J.’s lawyer and I have been working together to move their divorce forward privately, expeditiously and as amicably as possible.”</p><p>The statement continued: “Notwithstanding, we continue to be disappointed by T.J’s lack of discretion, respect and sensitivity toward Marilee and the party’s daughter. Marilee has been touched by the outpouring of support and looks forward to a new beginning in this new year.”</p><p>Holmes and Fiebig filed for divorce after 12 years of marriage on December 29, 2022, according to New York City court documents obtained by <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">TMZ</a>. The filing came two days after Holmes and Robach were <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">photographed</a> arriving arm in arm at Hartsfield-Jackson&nbsp; International Airport in Atlanta, Georgia the day after Christmas. The day of Holmes’ filing, he and Robach were photographed in Miami, Florida, where they spent New Year’s Eve together.</p><p>The week of New Year’s Eve, Fiebig also “liked” an <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Instagram</a> photo posted by Robach’s ex-husband Andrew Shue’s son Nate of him and his father and brothers, Aidan and Wyatt, in Montana. “RIDERS ON THE STORM. ON TO ‘23,” Nate captioned the post. (Shue shares Nate, Aidan and Wyatt with ex-wife Jennifer Hageney.)</p><p>A source told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Page Six</a> on December 2, 2022, that Fiebig was “blindsided” by Holmes and Robach’s affair. The insider explained that Holmes and Fiebig had been separated for six months but were trying to “work things out” when news broke of her husband and his co-anchor’s romance. “She’s devastated. She had no idea,” the insider said. “They haven’t been together in [a while], but they were trying to work it out. They were just together for T.J.’s birthday.” (Holmes celebrated his 47th birthday on August 19, 2022.)</p><p>The source also added that, while Fiebig had stopped wearing her wedding ring, she and Holmes were still trying to fix their relationship. Since news of her husband’s affair, Fiebig has made her Instagram private.</p><h2>Who else did TJ Holmes cheat on his wife with?</h2><p>Who else did TJ Holmes cheat on his wife Marilee Fiebig with? <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">The Daily Mail</a> reported on January 19, 2023, that Holmes had a months-long affair with ABC News coordinator Jasmin Pettaway in 2015 while he was still married to Fiebig. Pettaway was 24 years old at time, while Holmes was 37. “He was a predator who took full advantage of his position, and he was reckless,” a source told The Daily Mail. “It was Jasmin’s first real job in television, and it was a big deal for her. She was looking for a mentor, and she reached out to several people. T.J. was someone who was responsive, but he absolutely abused the position of trust.”</p><p>The Daily Mail reported that Holmes, who was an ABC News correspondent at the time, and Pettaway’s relationship started because they often worked the same shifts. “Holmes was someone who would grab drinks, and he and Jasmin started doing that,” the source said. According to the insider, the first time Holmes and Pettaway “got sexual” was “in his office” only a “couple hours” before he was set to go on the air. “They had sex, and I know she was confused afterwards as to what it meant,” the insider said. The source also claimed that Holmes’ actions with Pettaway wasn’t uncommon but part of his “incredibly reckless” behavior. The Daily Mail also reported that Holmes “got handsy” with Pettaway in public while they were having drinks. “He just didn’t seem to care,” the source said, claiming that Holmes was “wearing his [wedding] ring” at the time.</p><p>The source claimed that Holmes and Pettaway’s affair “fizzled out” after a few months, leaving the insider to wonder if Holmes was “ever invested in being a mentor at all.” “He had it all on his terms. He was interested and then he wasn’t,” the source said. “No one talked about abuse of power back then, but stuff happened.” An ABC News source told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Page Six</a> that “there is already an internal investigation underway into if anything happened between T.J. and Jasmin Pettaway.” The insider continued, “She was only at ABC News for a short period of time, but if they did have an affair when he was her superior, this would be a huge problem for T.J.”</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Page Six</a> also reported on December 2, 2022 that, before his relationship with Robach, Holmes cheated on Fiebig with at least two women at ABC News, including a three-year affair with married Good Morning America producer Natasha Singh that started in 2016.A source also told the site that Singh and Holmes, who were both close friends with Robach, would confide in her about the affair. “Amy was the person they went to talk to about their affair and marriages,” the insider said. Another source, however, denied that Robach knew of the affair until it was almost over. “She didn’t know about the affair until it was in its final stages. They told her about it right at the end,” the insider said.</p><p>Page Six reported that Holmes and Singh’s affair started off long distance, as Holmes is based in New York, while Singh is based in Los Angeles. Holmes, who was a correspondent at the time, would meet up with Singh when he traveled to Los Angeles, according to Page Six. Singh, who is also a yoga teacher and mediator, left Good Morning America in 2018 and moved to New York, where she started working as a producer on CBS Mornings, which is when her and Holmes’ relationship became more serious.&nbsp;“She fell in love with him. He had a key to her apartment,” another insider told Page Six.</p><p>Fiebig found out about the affair in 2019 after discovering emails between Holmes and Singh. A source also claimed that Fiebig’s focus on Singh was why she never thought Robach would also cheat with Holmes.&nbsp;“Marilee never considered Amy because she was focused on Natasha. She never thought about [him cheating] with Amy because they were friends. Amy’s daughter was their daughter’s babysitter,” the insider said. Holmes ended his affair with Singh soon after Fiebig found out, and the two worked on reconciling their marriage.</p><p>A source also told Page Six that Fiebig was upset that Robach still remained friends with Singh after Holmes ended their affair. “She would see photos of them on Instagram and she didn’t understand how their friend and her husband’s co-host could remain friends with the woman who tried to break up their marriage,” the insider said. The insider also explained that Robach and Singh’s friendship ended “around spring” of 2022 because Robach “was so close to TJ.”</p><p>Page Six also reported that Fiebig didn’t become suspicious of Robach until the summer of 2022 after noticing that she and Holmes seemed “closer than colleagues” after having random meetings throughout the day and going to the bar for drinks after work. The site reported that Holmes and Fiebig “were fully together” as of August 2022 and celebrated his 47th birthday in the Bahamas. It was on the vacation that Fiebig discovered a birthday card from Robach that seemed too personal for co-workers. “It brought back the old Natasha drama. She couldn’t trust him anymore,” a source told Page Six.</p><h2>Who is TJ Holmes’ wife, Marilee Fiebig?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/TJ-Holmes-Marilee-Fiebig.jpg><p>Who is TJ Holmes’ wife, Marilee Fiebig? Holmes and Fiebig, a lawyer, married in 2010 and split in 2022. They share one child together, daughter Sabine, who was born in 2013. He also has two other children, daughter Brianna and son Jaidan, from his marriage to Amy Ferson, whom he divorced in 2007.</p><p>Fiebig is an immigration lawyer who is admitted to practice in the state of Georgia and the state of New York, according to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Justia</a>. She graduated from Vanderbilt University Law School. Fiebig is also the Chief Diversity Office for the nonprofit organization Save the Children, where she’s worked since June 2021. According to an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Vanguard Law Magazine</a> in 2019, Fiebig was hired as a lawyer for Wilhelmina International Inc. in 2017. She went on to become the company’s Vice President of Operation and General Counsel, where she worked as an immigration lawyer to smooth the immigration process for young people to work in environments free from exploitation, harassment and other forms of abuse. “I credit the company for recognizing the importance of a woman’s point of view in upper management,” Holmes told the magazine at the time. “As a woman, I think I have a natural empathy for them [models] and can provide a unique perspective. I fully embrace that part of who I am.”</p><p>While at Wilhelmina, Fiebig worked specifically with foreign models. “We’ll collect all the necessary documentation to build a case for our models,”she said. “If there’s a way of showing why a model is extraordinary, we’ll find it.” She continued, “When I came on board, I don’t think the CEO [Bill Wackermann] or I could have foreseen all the industrywide issues about sexual harassment that were about to unfold. To his credit, he took it very seriously and found it beneficial to have someone with my skillset and perspective to help the company navigate this very sensitive area.”</p><p>Fiebig, one of three children who are all lawyers, was born in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and moved to the United States with her family when she was five years old. Her father, William Fiebig, was a former Peace Corps volunteer, while her mother, Pauline Fiebig, is a native of Congo. Fiebig received her United States citizenship while attending elementary school in Florida.&nbsp;“It was one of the proudest moments in my life,”Fiebig told Vanguard Law Magazine. “Though the process was more straightforward than it is today, it still wasn’t automatic. Given how passionate she was about education in light of the lack of similar opportunities she had growing up in the Congo, I was motivated at a very young age to further mine.”</p><p>Along with her legal career, Fiebig was also the Chief of Staff at Roc Nation. According to her Instagram, Fiebig is also on the Board of Trustees Board of Trustees for the Brooklyn Independent Middle School and works as a mentor for Unlock Her Potential.</p><h2>How did TJ Holmes and Marilee Fiebig meet?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Amy-Robach-TJ-Holmes.jpg><p>How did TJ Holmes and Marilee Fiebig meet? While it’s unclear how Holmes and Fiebig met, the two married in March 2010, three years after his divorce from his first wife, Amy Ferson. Holmes and Fiebig welcomed their first child together, a daughter named Sabine, in January 2013. In an essay for <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">The Root</a> to honor his and Fiebig’s four-year anniversary in 2014, Holmes wrote about his his marriage to Fiebig was different than his marriage to Ferson. “Not only is my marriage still intact, it’s, actually, working pretty well, and that made me uncomfortable,” he wrote. “You see, I didn’t fully understand why my marriage was flourishing, and I feared that if I didn’t understand what we were doing right, how would we know what to keep doing?”</p><p>He explained that his “eureka moment” in his marriage came that week when Fiebig helped him write a business email. “I asked my wife to review it, and she thought the tone of the email was too aggressive, confrontational and negative. She was right. Her input stopped me from making the mistake of hitting send,” Holmes wrote. “That innocuous example is emblematic of our entire relationship. In all I do, I have a partner looking out for me, advising me, keeping me on track and stopping me from making a mistake, no matter how great or small.”</p><p>Holmes explained that, though he was “still the same guy at my core,” he did see several positive changes to himself as a result of his marriage to Fiebig. “My family and I are closer, my individual net worth has gone up every year since we met, I’ve learned a second language, I’m healthier, I use the N-word less, I listen to Sunday church service more, I’m a better friend, I’m more forgiving than I used to be, I’m more involved in charitable work,” Holmes wrote. “In every way, I’m better off because I’m married. So, for me, a successful marriage has revolved around this principle: I like who I am with her.”</p><p>Holmes also honored Fiebig in a Facebook post for their 10-year anniversary in 2020. “This particular #decadechallenge is a little late, but … 10 years ago, Marilee Fiebig married me. And despite my best efforts, she remained married to me the past 10 years. That’s not hyperbole. I’m not being dramatic. I gave her plenty of reasons, excuses, and opportunities to walk her fine ass out the doooooooor. But instead, with her built-in black woman superpower, she showed a grace and patience that’s incomprehensible,” he wrote. “Asking her for another 10 years would be asking too much. Another 10 months? That may even be a stretch. If she gave me another 10 weeks, I should consider myself lucky. If she puts up with me another 10 days, I’d be grateful. But if she would even spare another 10 minutes of her time for me today, I should consider myself blessed.” He continued, “This is MARILEE FIEBIG HOLMES, y’all. And I, T. J. Holmes, do solemnly swear&nbsp; … that I … was HER.”</p><p>Holmes sparked rumors he and Fiebig had split in April 2022 when he shared a cryptic quote from his dressing room on Instagram that read: “End the relationship and cry once. It’s better than being with them and crying daily.” He captioned the post, “Quote of the week” with a crying-face emoji.&nbsp;Holmes deleted his Instagram in November 2022 after news broke of his and his Good Morning America co-host Amy Robach’s alleged affair. Fiebig’s Instagram has since been privated.</p><h2>Did Amy Robach and TJ Holmes have an affair?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Watch-This-Space.png><p>Did Amy Robach and TJ Holmes have an affair? <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Page Six</a> reported on November 30, 2022, that Good Morning America hosts, Amy Robach and TJ Holmes, left their spouses in August 2022 after a months-long affair. Robach was married to actor Andrew Shue since 2010, while Holmes was married to lawyer Marilee Fiebig since 2010. A source told Page Six at the time that Robach and Holmes’ affair started in March 2022 after they began training together for the New York City Marathon, which they were photographed together at on November 6, 2022, less than three weeks before news broke of their affair.</p><p>The GMA hosts were seen “canoodling” in bars near ABC News’ office in New York City in May 2022, and left their spouses in August 2022. “They have a very cozy relationship on air, but that is what is expected. But they were very careful behind the scenes to keep their affair secret. The producers at GMA are shocked to hear they are having an affair,” a source told Page Six at the time. The Daily Mail also reported at the time that rumors of Robach and Holmes’ affair first sparked in June 2022 “when they were in London together filming the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee for ABC and staff were buzzing about the intimacy between them,” a source said. The insider added, “Everyone knows that Amy and T.J. have been close friends for a long time now, running together and even socializing as a foursome with each other’s spouses.” The Daily Mail also reported that the head of ABC News, Kim Godwin, knew of Robach and Holmes’ affair before it went public.</p><p>A source also told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">People</a> at the time that there were rumors of an affair between Robach and Holmes in 2021, a year before their relationship became public. “There were rumors they were having an affair about a year ago,” the source said. “A lot of people believed there might have been some truth to it, because you can see there’s a mutual affection there. But everyone ultimately chalked it up to friendship because they always said they were both happily married.” Another source, however, denied the affair to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">People</a> at the time and claimed that Robach and Holmes’ romance didn’t start until after they separated from their spouses. “This was two consenting adults who were each separated. They both broke up with their spouses in August within weeks of each other,” the insider said. “The relationship didn’t start until after that.” The source continued, “She’s got nothing to hide. They were both separated so they felt very comfortable dating in the open after that. Their spouses had moved out, even! So they were not hiding anything.”</p><p>Robach restricted comments on her Instagram around November 2022 when fans noticed she wasn’t wearing her wedding ring in photos and hadn’t posted her husband for a while. Both Robach and Holmes have since deleted their Instagram accounts.</p><p>News broke of Robach and Holmes’ affair on November 30, 2022, after <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">The Daily Mail</a> published photos of the GMA hosts at O’Donoghue’s Irish Bar in New York City, near where Robach and Holmes film Good Morning America, where they were seen flirting with each other on November 10, 2022. A source told The Daily Mail at the time that Robach and Holmes went to the pair after filming a daily pre-recorded segment of Good Morning America. The Daily Mail reported that Robach and Holmes left ABC Studios separately and walked alone to the bar, where they reunited at a far corner in the restaurant. “They were totally into each other. She was giggling at whatever he was saying, and they were looking at each other’s phones. At one point she was kind of dancing in her chair to the music and laughing so hard she practically fell into his lap,” a source told The Daily Mail at the time. When they left, Robach stood about 20 feet away from Holmes on the sidewalk as he called an Uber. When the Uber, Robach and Holmes got in together and rode to Holmes’ downtown Manhattan apartment, where Robach was not seen leaving.</p><p>The next day, Holmes was seen leaving his apartment with a backpack and duffle bag. He was also seen going to a restaurant near Robach’s West Village apartment after they filmed their morning segment of Good Morning America. After he ate alone at the restaurant, Holmes walked around the corner and repeatedly looked over his shoulder before continuing up the block, where Robach was waiting to pick him up in her blue BMW convertible, according to The Daily Mail. Robach and Holmes then drove two hours north to the city of <span class=s1>Shawangunk Mountains, New York, where they checked into a remote cottage on the edge of Minnewaska State Park, where they brought their own food to cook and wine and beer to drink.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>When they left, Holmes could be seen grabbing and patting Robach’s butt as she bent over to load their bags and their leftover food and drinks into her car. Days later, while recording a segment on robes without Holmes for Good Morning America on November 16, 2022, Robach referenced her co-host’s love for robes. “I wish TJ was here,” Good Morning America contributor Tory Johnson said during the segment, to which Robach responded, “He loves his robes. He walks around the hallways with them.” A day later, on November 17, 2022, Holmes and Robach were seen again at New York University Langone, where Holmes was seen leaving with Robach and her best friend, who walked Robach’s golden doodle, Brody, while Holmes stayed in Robach’s apartment with her, according to The Daily Mail.</p><p>Good Morning America is available to stream on <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Hulu</a>.
