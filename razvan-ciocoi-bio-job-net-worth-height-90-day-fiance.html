Amanda and Razvan were one of the latter. In this writing called ‘Razvan Ciocoi Bio’ we shall talk about them and even more about Razvan alone.</p><h3><strong>90 Day Fiance: Before The 90 Days: Are Amanda Wilhelm And Razvan Ciocoi Still Together?</strong></h3><p>At the time of this writing, Amanda Wilhelm and Razvan Ciocoi still followed each other back on social media. However, in the trailer of 90 Day Fiance: Before The 90 Days, Razvan can be seen crying as Amanda tells him that maybe they are “just not right for each other.”</p><p>In the reality show, Razvan proved his worth to Amanda by helping her escape the grief of losing her husband. However, Amanda, Razvan’s girlfriend of four months, was also seen having issues with his job as an influencer. She seemed jealous of the attention he received. And this, onlookers worried might put an end to their relationship forever. While some even thought Amanda was choosing to get engaged to a “scammer in Romania” instead of seeking therapy.</p><p>Amanda as seen in the show, is a widowed single mom of two determined to travel across the world to see if what they have is real. In the process, she decided to go to Romania to meet Razvan. And what happens there is what the&nbsp;90 Day Fiancé viewers see.</p><p>Until now, there were no pictures of them together on their respective social media accounts, except for the promo for 90 Day Fiancé.</p><p>Before Razvan, Amanda was married to Jason Wilhelm who died on 19 March 2022 from ampullary cancer. Late Jason is described as a funny, caring, strong man who made a room light up by just being in it, in his obituary. It also reveals that he and Amanda were married for twelve years and they lived in Crestview, Florida with their son, Jason Wilhelm, Jr., and daughters, Jaylie Wilhelm, Maleah Wilhelm, and Aleena Wilhelm.</p><p>On the TLC show Amanda also spoke a couple of things about her deceased husband. She gushed that he was her best friend and that she never imagined a future without him. A year before she began filming for Before the 90 Days Jason started having lung problems. This is how Amanda described the whole thing.</p><p>Jason felt like he could have pneumonia or something in his chest and therefore got his X-rays, head scans, and CT scans done. But, initially, the doctors saw nothing. Some eight months after this, Jason was diagnosed with Stage 4 terminal ampullary cancer in his body. Three days later, Amanda forced a very weak Jason to go to the hospital, and just 10 days after he was gone.</p><h3><strong>Razvan Ciocoi Age</strong></h3><p>Razvan Ciocoi was born in 1996.

There are pictures of him promoting protein powder in shorts or hot and sweaty gym selfies.</p><h3><strong>Razvan Ciocoi Job</strong></h3><p>Razvan Ciocoi appears to be a big influencer in his country, especially on TikTok.
