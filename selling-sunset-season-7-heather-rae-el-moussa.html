In recent seasons, the Netflix reality series—focused on high-end Los Angeles real estate brokerage the Oppenheim Group—has followed the real estate agent as she has fallen in love, gotten married, and started a family with husband and HGTV star Tarek El Moussa.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">However, Heather’s infrequent appearances in season seven of Selling Sunset have fans wondering whether she’ll be back for future seasons of the show. Here’s what we know so far.</p><h2 data-node-id=2 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">Heather was on maternity leave during season seven.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Heather Rae El Moussa’s brief appearance at the start of Selling Sunset season seven showed her getting ready for the birth of her and Tarek’s first baby together. The couple’s son, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.instagram.com/p/CosTabvPidh data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Tristan Jay" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Tristan Jay</a>, was born on January 31, 2023, with Tarek sharing on <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.instagram.com/p/CoLXtp7PUnt/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Instagram class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Instagram</a>, “Mama & baby are happy, healthy, tired but doing well. Our hearts are so happy.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In an emotional <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.instagram.com/p/CosTabvPidh data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Instagram post" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Instagram post</a>, Heather revealed she’d experienced a difficult birth, with doctors rushing her to the hospital after the baby stopped moving as much as he should have been. Because of past medical issues, Heather’s water didn't break on its own, so labor was induced. “It all happened really fast,” she wrote on Instagram. “Tristan’s heart rate was dropping very low every time I’d push & was staying low. Which was terrifying.” Luckily, her baby boy was born safe and well, but it’s clear that Heather endured a traumatic time leading up to his birth.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">During an interview with E! News (via <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://people.com/home/heather-rae-el-moussa-reveals-selling-sunset-has-not-called-her-back-to-film-season-7-its-frustrating/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=People class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">People</a>) in March 2023, Heather revealed she was upset that Selling Sunset was filming without her. “Season seven is filming right now, but I’ve been off maternity leave and I’ve been excited to get back to work, and so far I have not been called back,” she said. She added, “It’s been a little frustrating. So [I’m] not sure what’s been going on."</p><h2 data-node-id=9 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">Heather and Tarek launched their own reality show.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Another reason Heather might not be as involved in future seasons of Selling Sunset is that she’s since launched her own reality show on HGTV, The Flipping El Moussas, in collaboration with Tarek. Tarek first rose to fame due to his work on HGTV’s Flip or Flop, which he starred on alongside ex-wife Christina Hall.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It makes sense that Heather and Tarek would want to combine their expertise into their own reality show, but there may be conflicts with Netflix’s Selling Sunset production schedule in the future. In July 2023, HGTV <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-12345299/Tarek-El-Moussa-wife-Heather-Rae-El-Moussas-HGTV-series-Flipping-El-Moussas-renewed-second-season.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="renewed The Flipping El Moussas" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">renewed The Flipping El Moussas</a> for a second season, meaning Heather will be spending a lot of her time filming that series.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Way back in August 2022, Oppenheim Group co-founder Brett Oppenheim discussed Heather’s future on Selling Sunset, following the announcement of her new HGTV show. “I think it’s TBD,” he told <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.eonline.com/news/1341235/jason-and-brett-oppenheim-tease-heather-rae-el-moussas-future-on-selling-sunset data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="E! News" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">E! News</a>. “I think for now she’s able to do both.” Twin brother and co-founder Jason Oppenheim also weighed in, saying, “I know she’s still going to be at the Oppenheim Group. I think that’s with her and production and Netflix and all that.” He continued, “I love Heather. I’m super supportive of Heather and Tarek and their new show … I hope she continues to film with us.”</p><h2 data-node-id=15 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">Heather reacted to Selling Sunset’s season-seven poster snub.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In October 2023, Heather took to Instagram to react to the latest promo poster for Selling Sunset, from which she was mysteriously missing. Joking about her absence from the photo, Heather wrote, “Looks like I got pushed in the water… its a good thing I can swim! Congrats to my girls on S7! 💗 You may see me in a few episodes….. 💁🏼‍♀️”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Luckily, Heather seemed to take the snub in good spirits, and showed nothing but support for her castmates. Still, it can’t have been easy to see the glossy picture featuring the rest of the show’s stars, but not her.</p><h2 data-node-id=19 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">Heather was diagnosed with an autoimmune disorder.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Also in October 2023, Heather revealed she’d been diagnosed with Hashimoto’s disease, an autoimmune disorder that causes a person’s immune system to attack their own thyroid gland. This can result in symptoms such as weight gain, fatigue, joint pain, and a slowed heart rate, the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/endocrine-diseases/hashimotos-disease data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</a> says.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Speaking to <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.today.com/parents/moms/heather-rae-el-moussa-autoimmune-disorder-rcna122315 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Today.com class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Today.com</a>, Heather explained, “I remember saying to my assistant, ‘I feel like I’m dead.’ … My brain was so tired. My body was so tired. I was exhausted all the time and no amount of sleep could make it better.” At first, Heather assumed the symptoms were postpartum issues, as she had recently given birth to Tristan Jay. “I was like, ‘I’m probably just foggy because of mom brain,’” she said.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">When she started struggling to produce milk, Heather was referred to a doctor who diagnosed her with Hashimoto’s disease. Fortunately, Heather told Today.com, she has been “feeling much better” since then. Still, it’s clear she has had a lot to deal with throughout 2023.</p><h2 data-node-id=24 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">Will Heather be back for season eight?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">If Selling Sunset returns to Netflix for an eighth season, there’s hope that Heather will be back on our screens. Not only has she made it clear she’d love to return to the series, her costars have also showed their support for the new mom.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In an interview with E!
