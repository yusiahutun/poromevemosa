While there is a long list of these products in the market, there are a few differences between the two, and knowing these variations is key to anybody who wishes to look dazzling regardless of the weather. Walking into a beauty store, you are bound to be spoilt for choice on which brand to select. But the billion-dollar question is, do you know how to tell if mascara is water-based or oil-based so that you can buy what you really need?</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/e38d96a8a00091b8.jpg><p class=align-left>With so many brands currently on the market, mascara users are not short of options when it comes to the products they need. Every mascara manufacturer is in stiff competition with the next company to ensure their products are the best performers. However, reports such as "the existence of mercury in mascara or lead in lipstick" prompt users to take a subtler approach when purchasing any of these products. Let us have a more in-depth look at your options, starting with mascaras that are water-based.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/90dd562f658d1a9f.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Dreads growth stages: Everything you need to know</span></p></a><h2>What is water-based mascara?</h2><p class=align-left>Mascaras that are water-based are almost similar to water-based foundations, especially when it comes to their removal. They are not waterproof, but they are <a id=https://www.foxnews.com/health/10-toxic-chemicals-to-avoid-in-eye-makeup href=# title="water-based mascara" rel="nofollow noopener">water-resistant</a> to some degree. If you are rained on while wearing mascara that is water-based, there is a likelihood that you will retain your look for a while. However, a lot of water will most likely remove some or all of your mascara. Then again, it also depends on the brand you purchase as some are knockoffs.</p><p class=align-left>All mascara with a water base comes with <a href=# title="water-soluble mascara" rel="nofollow noopener">natural hydrogen </a>PG levels. It is the best option for people with sensitive skin or skin allergies. The chemical-free nature of this type of mascara makes it the preferred option for most ladies, but it also has its drawbacks. Nonetheless, it is easy to remove and can dry up at a faster rate compared to its oil or silicone-based counterparts.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/f2b9a6d8f39142ce.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to start a water bottling company in Kenya</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/90dd562f658d1a9f.jpg><p class=align-left>Water-soluble mascara has a water base making it a prime example of this mascara type. The fact that it is soluble when water is introduced means you can easily remove the same using soap and water or your makeup remover. For ladies who wish to grow their lashes a little bit longer, this type of mascara is your best bet. Considering its effects are less harsh to your eyelashes, a mascara with a water base will always be trendy regardless of the modifications that hit the market.</p><p class=align-left>Some mascara products with a water base also come with ingredients that benefit your eyelashes in the long run. For starters, some come with vitamin B5, which helps promote healthy skin and hair. If you opt to purchase mascara products that are water-based, be sure to check the ingredients as well as the manufacturer. This seemingly small detail is the difference between authentic and smooth mascara and its smudgy counterparts.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/b810ef7d1526f8e0.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to request an Uber without the app</span></p></a><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO</strong>: How to get rid of ants in your house</p><h2>How about oil-based mascara, what is it, and what does it contain?</h2><p class=align-left>A mascara with an oil base is usually waterproof. The majority of the mascara options on beauty shop shelves labeled waterproof have an oil base. This type of mascara is not compatible with its water-based counterpart and offers a lot of smudge resistance. It is also regarded as the more <a href=# title="oil-based mascara" rel="nofollow noopener">popular option</a> as opposed to its water-based counterpart, seeing it lasts longer and can make your eyebrows look thicker.</p><p class=align-left>While it might be common among the ladies, this type of mascara is not ideal for people with skin or eye allergies. Some of the ingredients used include petroleum distillate, which can naturally cause irritation or even a breakout. However, the same is balanced by other non-toxic ingredients such as mineral oil, castor oil, and carnauba wax, to mention a few. These and many other ingredients help this type of mascara repel water droplets while ensuring your eyelashes retain their color pigmentation.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/32d4b143719e07eb.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to use body scrub at home</span></p></a><p class=align-left>With mascara that is oil-based, there are fewer chances of getting the same smudged all over your face, especially when it's raining. Its tendency to never spread on your face when wet is what makes this mascara option the best for many women around the globe. The possibilities are endless; you can go for a swim or walk in the rain without a thought on your facial appearance. It is also easy to keep these types of mascara for long, seeing most of them contain preservatives as an extra ingredient.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/f2b9a6d8f39142ce.jpg><h2>How to tell makeup is oil-based and waterproof?</h2><p class=align-left>There are several ways of how to tell if mascara is water-based or oil-based. The first and most crucial method is checking the product’s ingredients. If you come across ingredients such as paraffin or hyaluronic acid, chances are the product is oil-based. Components such as siloxane or methicone indicate the product is silicone-based, while water-based makeup or mascara contains less chemical terms.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/8f6330630dd06d90.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Beautiful no makeup quotes and sayings on natural beauty</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Some products also indicate whether they are water, silicone, or oil-based on the bottle, so be sure to look out for such details. If you are not certain, ask for help from the beauty shop's personnel. Seeing oil-based makeup or mascara is generally waterproof, you can also use water to test the same. If it has an oil base, the mascara will stay in place without creating any messes. This strong holding power means your eyelashes will remain curled for the longest time possible.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO</strong>: Aleize Sampson bio, current partner, daughter, net worth, photos</p><p class=align-left>While water-based makeup is easy to remove, its oil-based equivalent strongly holds onto your eyelashes. However, it also dehydrates your lashes at a faster rate compared to mascara with a water base. It does this due to ingredients such as waxes and in some instances, silicone, which actively repel tears, water, and sweat. These ingredients are responsible for mascara's waterproof nature. The ingredients are also capable of breaking your lashes or causing them to fall off.</p><p class=align-left>Always remove oil-based makeup and mascara at the end of the day regardless of the rigorous process involved to prevent <a href=# title="how to tell makeup is oil-based" rel="nofollow noopener">dried out lashes</a>.</p><p class=align-left>With the explanation above, you now know how to tell if mascara is water-based or oil-based. It is upon you to decide which mascara type suits you best, but be sure to consider the effect of the same on your skin. If you have any eye or skin allergies, contact your physician before settling on a particular mascara brand.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong></p><ul><li>How to toast without a toaster</li><li>Hair Regime: Why the need for different strength hair relaxers</li><li>30 easy things to draw when bored</li></ul><p>Source: TUKO.co.ke</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tcHKqGWcp16gsnB%2FkWpqbnFdnby4ecyaqpyZopZ6uK3TnqlmmpGosqV5zqKjZpqRqLKlesetpKU%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./article-1b5defac-06ef-11ee-a352-7f38981051bc-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Mandy Lamb Evert | Obituaries">&larr;
