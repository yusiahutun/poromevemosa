Remember, though, there was one catch: The makeover lasted only until midnight. With his InstaBreast technique, Norman Rowe, a New York plastic surgeon, is playing fairy godmother to women temporarily seeking larger, fuller breasts, but his handiwork also lasts for only one night. In about 20 minutes, you can go from flat-chested to cleavage-proud.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Rowe's method is remarkably simple: He designates a site at the edge of each nipple, and after the area is anesthetized, he injects about a half-liter of sterile saline solution—essentially salt water—into the patient's breast tissue. He maneuvers the needle at various angles to different areas, expanding each breast until it reaches the desired fullness. The saline is gradually absorbed into the bloodstream, with the full effect lasting about 24 hours. (Rowe says that saline is considered perfectly safe; it's the same stuff you would get in an IV if you were dehydrated.)</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">While some doctors suggest that instant breast augmentation is just a fad, it's hard to ignore its potential (consider the hundreds of thousands of women who don't hesitate to have volumizers injected their face). And the desire for bigger breasts is as popular as ever: According to the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery, 313,327 breast augmentations and 137,233 breast lifts were performed in the U.S. in 2013. "Women want cleavage," Rowe says matter-of-factly. "And this is fast."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Fast results were just what Shavon Jovi, 28, a model and aspiring actress, was hoping for when she underwent the procedure with Rowe several months ago. After a few pricks of an anesthetic into the skin surrounding the nipples, Rowe injected anesthetic-laced saline solution into her 32A breasts, one syringe at a time. The effect was an instant fullness that brought her chest to a C cup. "For the longest time I've wanted to get a breast augmentation," says Jovi. "I was sort of shocked when I saw them, but I loved it immediately." Within two days she was back to her natural size (how long it takes depends on how your body metabolizes the fluid). So why have the now-you-see-'em, now-you-don't procedure? Like many of Rowe's patients, Jovi wanted to "try on" implants in a way that computer imaging just can't mimic, says Rowe, adding that some of his patients go for the temporary inflation for special occasions, such as a wedding, a big birthday, or a beach vacation.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Nicole, a 30-year-old mother of two, spent a day walking around with saline-inflated breasts, and a few months later went under the knife for implants. "It was amazing to see what my breasts would be like," she recalls. As for how it felt? "I've had Botox and fillers, and it's similar." About 75 percent of Rowe's patients who opt for the $2,500 procedure go on to get implants. However, it isn't a helpful test-drive for every woman. "If you need bother a lift and an augmentation, the saline won't give you a realistic approximation," explains Rowe.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Not everyone is singing the praises of the short-lived boob job, and there are limitations and risks to it. Since the skin of both breasts is pierced by the needle, bruising can occur. And like any procedure that penetrates the skin, infection is possible. Some doctors see other downsides as well, cautioning that undergoing the procedure repeatedly could cause the skin to stretch—"like a Slinky that you stretch out past the point of no return," says Adam Kolker, a plastic surgeon in New York. Rowe counters that this is highly unlikely. "The skin has to be stretched for a much longer and continuous time period for it to display permanent stretching," he says. Heidi Waldorf, a New York dermatologist, agrees, noting that having the procedure once is "probably okay. As long as it's short-lived, the area should return to its normal contour," says Waldorf, but she has concerns about stretching for those who return for more.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">For her part, Jovi wanted to capture the results before they faded away. "I definitely posted a few #InstaBoob selfies that day," she says. In the spirit of the procedure, though, perhaps she should have used Snapchat.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfl7KiwdOyZqGdkaHBqXvAbWpxaF9ngW60zq6pZpqfpK9uts6bZGpqYWp8</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./jeremiahs-italian-ice-to-open-next-month.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jeremiahs Italian Ice to Open Next Month">&larr;
