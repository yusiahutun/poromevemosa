Faze Banks is a famous American video game player also known as Ricky Banks. What he likes to do has made him famous, and there is certainly no limit to what he can achieve with it.</p><p>He belongs to a generation of young and promising celebrities who are popular today for what they do on the Internet of Things. These young talents are homemade, which most people do for fun, they have turned it into a means of wealth and an identity for popularity. Here we will discuss Faze Banks Height, Girlfriend, Family, House, Wiki, Bio, Net Worth, and, without neglecting the most frequently asked question, his wealth.</p><h2><strong>Faze Banks Wiki, Bio,&nbsp;Family</strong></h2><p>Faze Banks, also known as Ricky Banks, was born on 18 October 1991 in Lawrence Massachusetts, USA. He grew up in Lowell and in his older years moved to Florida. He graduated from Lowell High School in 2010. Faze Banks loved to play video games as a child, from his teens and later as an adult. As a child, he loved to play games like Madden NFL, NHL, and Halo. His skill and mastery in playing the games he saw like no other as the leader of the SoaR game team before joining the now-famous Faze Clan.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Faze-Banks.jpg><p>Faze has not divulged detailed information about his education and family background; his parents, who they are, and whether or not he has siblings. It is not surprising that he kept such information safely away from the public, as most prominent players do. Maybe it’s one thing among them, or maybe the public and social media weren’t convincing enough to let them reveal answers to these very much-asked questions. Well, as time goes on, as their net worth expands, their fame will obviously reveal the once-classified information. Keep in mind, however, that his parents are from Florida and are both white Americans.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Brett Ambler Bio, Age, Height, Family, and Quick Facts</a></strong></p><p>Celebrity Faze began his gaming career as a solo player in late 2011.
