They're also becoming cheaper, so you can customize your keyboard without burning a hole in your wallet.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>That said, there are scores of different mechanical switches you can choose from today. But among all the choices, Cherry MX, Kailh, and Gateron are among the most popular.</p><p>But which one's the best?</p><h2 id=cherry-mx-kailh-and-gateron-the-basics>Cherry MX, Kailh, and Gateron: The Basics</h2><p>Mechanical switches come in a lot of different shapes and sizes. So, before we get to a comparison, it's better to establish a baseline. In this case, that's going to be Cherry MX.</p><p>Kailh and Gateron are, for the most part, Cherry MX clones. While the two switch manufacturers have some unique switch types, their three basic ones originate from Cherry MX switches. There are <a href=#>other alternatives to Cherry MX switches</a>, but these are arguably the most popular.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Outemu-switch-samples-mounted-on-the-keyboard.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As you might already know, mechanical switches are divided into three main classes. We've already covered the <a href=#>differences between linear, tactile, and clicky switches</a>, but colors also vary them:</p><ul><li><strong>Red Switches:</strong> These are linear switches and don't make a lot of sounds.</li><li><strong>Blue Switches:</strong> These are known for their tactile feedback with a distinct clicky sound.</li><li><strong>Brown Switches:</strong> These are tactile switches similar in response to Blue switches but without the unique sound signature.</li></ul><p>Cherry started using colors to differentiate switches based on their unique characteristics, and it has caught on with every switch manufacturer since. Over time, different switch makers, including Cherry, have developed new switches identified by different colors with their own characteristics.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>That said, the base three classes are still what you'd most likely end up getting unless you know exactly what you want. If this is your first time experimenting with mechanical switches, we recommend choosing a style based on your preferences and trying it out before dipping your toes in the sea of mechanical switches available today.</p><p>The basic rule of thumb is that you can't go wrong with Cherry MX switches. Not only do these have the original switch design, but they're also the industry standard for high-quality mechanical switches. That said, availability and price concerns might make you want to look for alternatives.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Adafruit-MacroPad-RP2040-Starter-Kit-Focus-on-Mechanical-Key-Switches.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This is where Kailh and Gateron come through. Gaterons are generally considered better than Kailhs due to their low actuation force (the force required to activate a switch) and smooth operation. Kailhs tend to feel a bit scratchy, which gives the impression that the switch is heavier to activate, but they perform just fine.</p><p>Another significant difference between the three is their sound signature. Even though Kailh and Gaterons are Cherry MX clones, all three are made from different materials. That means they can sound quite different from each other.</p><p>Cherry MX switches tend to sound pretty flat, and the Gaterons follow suit. On the other hand, Kailhs sometimes sound hollow. However, keep in mind that the way a keyboard sound varies drastically.</p><p>Aside from switches, the chassis and mods you have will affect it. Switch lubing also has a massive effect on the way your keyboard sounds.</p><h2 id=do-cherry-mx-kailh-and-gateron-switches-perform-any-differently>Do Cherry MX, Kailh, and Gateron Switches Perform Any Differently?</h2><p>We've already reviewed <a href=#>how mechanical keyboards work</a>, and mechanical switches aren't entirely different. That said, when it comes to performance, all three will get the job done just fine.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>I used a budget mechanical keyboard featuring Kailh Blue switches every day for four years straight, and every switch still works just as fine as it did when the keyboard was new. That's partly because the Kailh switches on my keyboard were nearly identical to the Cherry MX Blues.</p><p>Regardless, the sound and overall typing experience were just fine, especially given the $35 price tag of the RedGear MK 881 keyboard they came in.</p><p>My experience with the Gaterons, however, has been far better. Compared to the Kailh Blues, the Gateron Blue switches in my Keychron K2 V2 are far easier on my fingers, despite their actuation force being one gram less than the Kailh Blue's 61g. The difference here was that Gateron switches I used were pre-lubed, which led to a much smoother user experience.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/05/gateron-blue-mechanical-switch-1.JPG><p>Finally, Cherry MX switches feel even better. To be clear, they aren't a massive leap from the Gaterons, and depending on the batch you get, the difference might not be that obvious at first. But after multiple typing sessions, you'll start seeing the even smoother operation and better sound that give Cherry MX switches the edge.</p><p>Remember that these blue switches from all three companies are practically identical in terms of specs on paper. Small things like switch lubrication and the use of heavier plastic in the switch case make all the difference here.</p><p>While the type of switch you end up using will depend mainly on the kind of typing experience you prefer, you can be sure that any switch from all three companies will last you quite a while without issues like missed actuations or other internal malfunctions.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>That said, Cherry MX switches provide the best experience and the longest life at 100 million actuations, followed by Gaterons and the Kailhs, rated for 50 million actuations.</p><h2 id=pricing-and-availability>Pricing and Availability</h2><p>This is where the real difference between the three switch companies becomes clear. A pack of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored nofollow" class="norewrite noskim">10 Cherry MX blue switches</a> costs $16.99 on Amazon. On the other hand, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored nofollow" class="norewrite noskim">ten Gateron Blues</a> will run you $9.99 on Amazon.</p><p>That's a massive difference, which becomes even greater when you consider that you can get a<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"> 35-piece Kaihl Blue Switch Set</a> for the same $9.99 price tag on the Kaihl website.</p><p>To put this into perspective, if you deck out an 84-key mechanical keyboard, you must spend $152.91 if you want Cherry MX Blues. But if you go for Gateron switches, you'll only pay $89.91. But, if you're on a budget, you only need to spend $29.97 on Kailh Blues—and you'll still have 21 extra switches.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Add to those the cost of a good barebones mechanical keyboard kit, which starts at around $60, and you'll see the appeal that Kailh switches offer.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/best-mechanical-keyboards.jpg><p>Prices are generally consistent across most switch types, meaning regardless of the kind of switch you pick, you'll end up paying significantly more for Cherry MX switches than those from Gateron or Kailh.</p><p>As far as switch availability is concerned, unfortunately, that varies a lot based on your geographical location. Generally speaking, you're likely to find Kailhs and Gaterons easily but might have difficulty getting your hands on Cherry MX switches due to their high demand.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=which-mechanical-switch-is-the-best>Which Mechanical Switch Is The Best?</h2><p>As much as we'd like to give you a clear winner, your choice of a mechanical switch is a highly personal decision. You should choose based on the feel of a particular switch on your current mechanical keyboard setup.</p><p>If you prefer Kailhs to Cherry MX switches or Gaterons to Kailhs, by all means, go for them. We recommend trying out as many switches as you can get your hands on and deciding for yourself. That's also <a href=#>one of the reasons why you need a hot-swappable keyboard</a>.</p><p>However, as mentioned before, Cherry MX switches are generally the best mechanical switches you can get, albeit at a hefty price. I personally recommend Gateron Switches because they balance quality, typing experience, and cost.</p><p>Finally, try and avoid Kailhs unless you're bound by budget requirements or specifically want them.</p><h2 id=make-an-informed-choice>Make an Informed Choice</h2><p>Adding a mechanical keyboard to your desk can make your experience significantly better, especially if you type a lot.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Your keyboard is the peripheral you likely interact with the most, making your choice of mechanical switches a rather important decision—one where you have a lot of choice and freedom to customize your typing experience exactly how you prefer.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3KnqysnZ%2Bbe6S7zGiaoZ2ip8Zuuddmraxlm5a2rbSMr6pmn5GpsrO7zWaqsKGkmLWmv44%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./gucci-manes-1017-records-signee-hotboy-wes-arrested-in-texas.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Gucci Manes 1017 Records Signee Hotboy Wes Arrested In Texas">&larr;
