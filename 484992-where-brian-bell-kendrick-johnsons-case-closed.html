He was arrested in connection with the death of Kendrick Johnson. This happened after the police discovered some incriminating evidence. Here are some interesting facts you should know about him.</p><h3>1. Brian was a prime suspect in Kendrick’s murder</h3><p class=align-left>Their initial suspect in Kendrick’s murder was Brian Bell. He <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">reportedly had beef with him</a> due to his athlete status winning him girls. Although the local law enforcement offered a different ruling, his parent was unconvinced by the results. The parents allegedly claimed there was foul play and an attempted cover-up by the school in Johnson's death.</p><h3>2. The personality is a talented athlete</h3><p class=align-left>Before the Kendrick Jackson lawsuit, Brian was an <a href=#>athletic student</a>. He has recently been included in reports from the athletic scouting magazine. Despite keeping a low profile, avoiding the spotlight, and avoiding the media, glimpses of Brian Bell in public have been made. The scouting magazine documented his hiring as a backline from Valdosta, Georgia.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/a6d5975604d3ee96.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Charlie Tan's release date and what happened to his family members</span></p></a><h3>3. He was mentioned in Kendrick Johnson's parents’ petition</h3><p class=align-left>Johnson's parents did not believe their son's death was accidental and initiated a second petition calling for another<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> autopsy report</a>. They then hired a private coroner who determined the cause of death to be a result of blunt force trauma to the upper neck on the right.</p><p class=align-left>Their results were shockingly different from initial state reports and warranted the case reopening in 2021. The petition reportedly mentioned how Brian Bell lured Johnson into the gym with another female student. Thereafter the two brothers fatally beat him and placed him on a mat.</p><p class=align-left>Jay Holden also mentioned in the petition how Johnson was loved by girls due to his success as a <a href=#>high school </a>athlete. He allegedly inspired jealousy among the male students.</p><h2>4. Brian was not the actual murderer in Kendrick’s case</h2><p class=align-left>Did the Bell brothers kill Kendrick Johnson? No. The case was closed after Brian Bell's statement on Kendrick Johnson <a href=# title rel="nofollow noopener">refuting the murder</a> claims. Brain and Branden produced video surveillance footage and alibis that confirmed their whereabouts on the fateful night of January 10, 2013.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/b5f6429a53dabc5f.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Where is Jason Worley now? Whereabouts of Brandi Worley's husband</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The Lowndes County Superior Court Senior Judge Richard Porter dismissed the lawsuit, touring lawyer Chevene King of fabricating evidence. The man in question had already served prison for making untrue allegations. The Sheriff instantly realized the tape was faked after he confessed, identifying him as the source.</p><p class=align-left>The events at Lowndes County High School in 2013 were unfortunate and ill-timed. The life of an aspiring 17-year-old was cut short, robbing Kenneth and Jacquely Johnson of their child. Since then, many have been questioning the whereabouts of Brian Bell. He is undertaking his university studies and was acquitted of the murder charges.</p><p class=align-left>Tuko.co.ke published an article about <a href=#>Jim J. Bullock</a>.
