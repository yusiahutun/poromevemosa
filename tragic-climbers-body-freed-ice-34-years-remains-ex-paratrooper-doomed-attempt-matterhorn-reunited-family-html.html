There was a mummified hand, with nails and skin, and cupped, as if it was waiting to be held.</span><br></p><p><span>‘It was 34 years on and I was holding my brother’s hand. It was bittersweet but wonderful. It took ages for the DNA results to come through but they confirmed what we already knew.’</span><br></p><p><span>Mr Conville’s remains have since been cremated and the family are still deciding where to scatter his ashes. Mrs Taee added: ‘It will be somewhere in the mountains he loved.’</span><br></p><ul><li><b><span>For more information on the Jonathan Conville Memorial Trust, visit <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=# style=font-weight:700>www.jcmt.org.uk</a></span></b></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaKaVrMBwrdGtoJyklWJ%2FdoGUbmtpZ4Snrqi1wmaapaGdl7Kzv4ybpp2xXZu%2FprHDZqCcnV1ogW7FxJqprGWCmrqitc2sZJ6wXaWus63Tq6aoqJWneqW7zqacnWWRqcGmuc%2BtZIaZpKmys7TOq6VmqpWqu6rAxJ1kn5mdnrm6esetpKU%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./the-bachelor-charity-lawson-details-past-relationships-infidelity-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Charity Lawson Details Past Relationships and 'Infidelity'">&larr;
