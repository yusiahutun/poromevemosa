Drake was born Aubrey ‘Drake’ Graham on October 24 1986 to Sandi and Dennis Graham. He derives his African-American genes from his father a native of Memphis Tennessee and he owes his Canadian Jewish descent to his mother. On a lighter note, we know that Drake’s height cannot be attributed to his mother.</p><p>Drake’s interest in entertainment and shows has not started in recent days; it started very early. He was first recognized for his role in the popular TV series Degrassi: The Next Generation which he left in 2007 to pursue and focus on his rap career. After a few mix-tapes, he went on tour with rapper Lil Wayne in 2008 and was signed to his Young Money Entertainment label in June 2008 Drake was on roll and since then he remains just as relevant.</p><p><img data-lazyloaded=1 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Drake-Height.jpg fetchpriority=high decoding=async alt="Drake’s Height, Weight And Measurements" width=787 height=443 title="Drake’s Height, Weight And Measurements" data-sizes="(max-width: 787px) 100vw, 787px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Drake has come a long way since then as he now holds the record for the most hits on Billboard’s R&B/Hip-Hop Chart. He also created a brand October’s Very Own (OVO) with subsidiaries such as OVOSOUND and OVOFEST. Drake is the proud owner of a clothing line and his own channel on ‘Beats 1’ he is currently an ambassador for ‘The Toronto Raptors ‘. Drake’s net worth is currently estimated at $55 million.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>The Weeknd Wiki, Net Worth, Age, Height, Girlfriend, Bio, Family</a></strong></p><h2><strong>Drake’s Height</strong></h2><p>Before getting to the point here is a brief description of the phenomenal rapper Drake who has a medium-built athletic figure and fair skin due to his mixed ethnicity with dark brown eyes and hair. He often grows his beard or leaves a shadow but it has been a long time since we have seen a well-shaved Drake.</p><p>The god of height obviously smiled at him and he should be grateful to them he is 1.83 m (6 feet) tall with personalities like Elvis Presley the king of rock and roll John Kennedy the 35th President of the United States and <a href=#>Vin Diesel</a> the popular action movie actor.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Drake-Height.jpg><p>Drake dodged a few “short” genes from his mother Sandi who is 4 feet 8 inches (1.42 m) tall putting her in the same size category as the popular reality TV star Nicole Elizabeth Polizzi known as Snooki. Being small is not a sin but we can all say that we are grateful for Drake’s height.</p><h2><strong>Drake’s Weight</strong></h2><p><img data-lazyloaded=1 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/drake-Weight.jpg decoding=async alt="Drake’s Height, Weight And Measurements" width=745 height=489 title="Drake’s Height, Weight And Measurements" data-sizes="(max-width: 745px) 100vw, 745px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Adequate weight is very important for public figures like Drake. He may not have a polished and built environment but he has kept a silhouette that makes it even more attractive. He is no stranger to the gym and this is obvious as he weighs 69 kg which is not at all out of the ordinary for a man of his age and height he also looks at what he eats although it is not only for his weight but because Jewish culture has one or two food restrictions.</p><h2><strong>Drake’s Body Measurements</strong></h2><p><img data-lazyloaded=1 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Drake-Shirtless-Body.jpg decoding=async alt="Drake’s Height, Weight And Measurements" width=714 height=405 title="Drake’s Height, Weight And Measurements" data-sizes="(max-width: 714px) 100vw, 714px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>He has a certain aura of softness which can be attributed to Drake’s height build weight and overall appearance. The fact that he is well-defined but not “torn” has given him an advantage over the ladies and as a result, most of his songs appeal to the female audience.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Takeoff Migos Bio, Age, Net Worth, Height, Dating, Girlfriend, Family</a></strong></p><p>Drake’s chest is one of his most precious assets and it is difficult not to notice it, especially with all the very distracting bare-chested pictures we see of him recently. Drake’s chest size is 41 inches and this must be one of the reasons why he is not ashamed to display it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Drakes-mom.jpg><p>His physique is incredibly proportionate and with him, he commands a subtle but powerful aura it’s almost confusing but damn it we love it! Drake’s biceps are 14 inches long and his waist is 30 inches. He gives the impression that it is almost effortless but we know that it takes hard work and compromise.</p><p>It should not be difficult for Drake to find his shoes in almost any part of the world his size is quite moderate and accessible. Just in case you’re wondering Drake wears a shoe size 11 US his Euro size is 41-42 and his UK size is 9.</p><p><img data-lazyloaded=1 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Drake-Body.jpg decoding=async alt="Drake Body" width=665 height=349 title="Drake’s Height, Weight And Measurements" data-sizes="(max-width: 665px) 100vw, 665px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>In all his fame and glory we can’t help but love Drake he started at the bottom of the ladder and now he’s here with his admirable portfolio and statistics.</p><h2><strong>Quick Facts About Drake</strong></h2><table class="table biofactstable"><tbody readability=19.5><tr><th>Date of Birth:</th><td>24 November 1986</td></tr><tr><th><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-adjust"></i>Age:</th><td>34 years old</td></tr><tr><th><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></i>Birth Nation:</th><td>Canada</td></tr><tr><th><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-tower"></i>Height:</th><td>5 Feet 9 Inch</td></tr><tr><th>Name</th><td>Drake</td></tr><tr><th>Birth Name</th><td>Aubrey Drake Graham</td></tr><tr><th>Nick Name</th><td>Drake, Aub</td></tr><tr readability=2><th>Father</th><td>Dennis Graham (Drummer who worked with Jerry Lee Lewis)</td></tr><tr readability=2><th>Mother</th><td>Sandi Graham (n�e Sher)(Educator)</td></tr><tr><th>Nationality</th><td>Canadian</td></tr><tr><th>Birth Place/City</th><td>Toronto, Ontario, Canada</td></tr><tr><th>Religion</th><td>Judaism</td></tr><tr><th>Ethnicity</th><td>Multiracial</td></tr><tr readability=6><th>Profession</th><td>Rapper, singer, songwriter, record producer, actor</td></tr><tr><th>Net Worth</th><td>$60 million</td></tr><tr><th>Eye Color</th><td>Dark Brown</td></tr><tr><th>Hair Color</th><td>Black</td></tr><tr><th>Shoe Size</th><td>13 (US)</td></tr><tr><th>Weight in KG</th><td>77 kg</td></tr><tr readability=27><th>Girlfriend</th><td>Maliah Michel, Keshia Chante (2000-2002), Nebby (2002-2006), Cat Washington (2006-2008),Bria Myles (2008-2009),Vanessa Veasley (2009) ,Teyana Taylor (2009),Nicki Minaj (2009-2010),Shanell Woodgett (2010),Taraji P.
