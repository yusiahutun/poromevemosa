For her surgery, she went to two different doctors: Dr. Rodriguez and Dr. Fernando Ortega. They are both located in Columbia (the country). She visited the country and stayed there for 14 days because she was out of the country and had to be in the doctor’s care for that period of time because she was to be monitored during that time.</p><p>Razor explained that she underwent two surgeries. Her first surgery was in April 2018 when she got BBL (Brazilian Butt Lift). She waited six months and two weeks for her second surgery. She went for a second surgery because she wanted her “a*s completely fatter, I wanted my t***** done, I wanted my stomach flat, I wanted more hip.” However, she didn’t want to look like a stripper.</p><p>Dr. Ortega performed her breast implants and she is a full C-cup almost close to D. She cannot breastfeed. For the second round of surgery, she had to stay there for 16 days. She stayed in Lluxe Recovery during that time.
