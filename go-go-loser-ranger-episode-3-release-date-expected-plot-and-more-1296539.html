Loser Ranger</a>! began with Footsoldier D getting fed up with his existence and finally deciding to infiltrate the Rangers after disguising himself as an aspirant to take the enlistment exam. He participates in a running test that determines if candidates are fit to join the force. He later goes to the HQ to find the Dragon Keepers, filled with determination to end them, only to find that they are not there.&nbsp;</p><p>However, he does meet Hibiki Sakurama, who asks him to become a ranger in the first episode and is really happy to see him take the exam. Yumeko Suzukira then makes an appearance and tells Hibiki to not be too excited as D is far from his goal of becoming a ranger yet. The trio goes to get lunch together and talk about the Rangers’ achievements. During lunch, he learns that each of the Divine Rangers has their own Garrisons.</p><p>Elsewhere, the Divine Rangers go to the Flying Fortress to meet the monsters. They vilify the monsters for breaking their trust and threaten to kill them if they do not cooperate. When Hibiki tells Footsoldier D that he has to deliver a letter to The Red Keeper’s Garrison, the latter takes the appearance of Hibiki and goes there in his place along with Yumeko.&nbsp;</p><p>Once in the Red Garrison, he encounters Tokito, whom he mistakes for the Red Keeper, and almost kills him with the knife he hid in his purse. However, Tokito turns out to be Hibiki’s junior. While getting back from the Red Garrison, D finally gets to meet Sosei Akabane, aka the Red Keeper. Afterwards, Yumeko finds out Footsoldier D’s real identity and tells him that she wants them to work together to defeat the Divine Rangers, and assures him that she can help him become strong enough to defeat them. This hints at her secret past with the organization that we might get to see later.</p><span class=f14>Advertisement</span><p>At the end of the episode, we see Footsoldier F fighting against the Divine Rangers all by himself. However, he is killed by the Red Keeper who uses his Divine Artifact, Yamato no Orochi, to defeat him.</p><p class=also_read_style><strong>ALSO READ:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=# onclick='triggerCommentfollowAlsoClick("article_also_read_click","Go!
