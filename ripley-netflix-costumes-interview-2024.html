The 1999 adaptation of Patricia Highsmith’s classic novel—starring Matt Damon in the title role, alongside Jude Law and Gwyneth Paltrow—is a sartorial fever dream, transporting viewers to a 1950s Italian Riviera where camp shirts, dreamy tailoring, and colorful swim trunks intertwine with a psychosexual thriller for the ages. The film’s atmosphere is deeply unnerving, and by its breathless conclusion, we’ve learned the clothes have played a pivotal role in seducing the audience along the way. That’s because the character of Tom Ripley is all about presentation. We see him the way he wants us to see him—which makes his story, in any format, a luscious opportunity for fashion as storytelling.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Netflix’s Ripley—created, written, and directed by Steven Zaillian, and starring Andrew Scott in the lead role and Dakota Fanning—revisits Highsmith’s source material to stunning effect. While there are winks to the 1999 film, this new eight-episode miniseries makes a dramatic departure from the sun-drenched, color-saturated world we thought we knew, bringing us instead into a sleek, black-and-white reimagining of the novel. In Ripley’s grayscale world, clothing exudes mystery and meaning, and a monochromatic presentation serves only to heighten the textures and silhouettes we see onscreen.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Bazaar caught up with Giovanni Casalnuovo, who codesigned Ripley’s costumes alongside Maurizio Millenotti, to learn more about how the duo dressed this iconic story in a brand-new way.</p><h2 data-node-id=5 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>What was your overall thesis for bringing this novel to life through costume?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Our core approach to costuming Ripley was to create a visually distinct world that captured the essence of the novel while offering a new perspective compared to the previous adaptations.</p><h2 data-node-id=7 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>The Talented Mr. Ripley is considered one of the most stylish films of all time. How did you seek to reference—or deviate from, without referencing—that film?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The 1999 film is a true style inspiration, and Ann Roth’s and Gary Jones’s costume design is undeniably iconic. We approached our series with immense respect for their work, but with a distinct focus. Our guiding light was the exceptional script, which served as a brilliant translation of Patricia Highsmith’s captivating novel. We saw an opportunity to delve deeper into the complexities of the characters and their journeys, crafting a visually distinct world that honored the richness of the book.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">This meant going beyond referencing the film’s stylistic choices. The black-and-white format itself presented a unique challenge. While the 1999 film used color to great effect, we had to rely on other elements to differentiate characters and portray social standing. This constraint became an exciting opportunity to explore silhouette, texture, and patterns in even greater detail. For example, a character’s social status might be hinted at through the sharpness of their suit or the quality of the fabric. Similarly, a bold geometric pattern could suggest a rebellious spirit, while classic stripes might convey a timeless elegance. These details, meticulously considered thanks to the script’s depth, became a silent language woven into the costumes.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">While viewers familiar with the film might recognize subtle echoes here and there, our overall goal was to create a different and unique costuming experience that pays homage to the novel’s complexities.</p><img alt="ripley andrew scott" title=RIPLEY width=3600 height=2400 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/ripley-pa-102-100421-01012-r-6627e257655ef.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Netflix</span></p><h2 data-node-id=12 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>Did the black-and-white format feel daunting going in? Did you also see it as an opportunity?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Black-and-white was definitely frightening at first! In today’s world of vibrant color films, it felt like a bold choice. We, as costume designers, are used to relying on color to define characters and set moods in scenes. But as we delved deeper, the limitations of black-and-white became a fascinating creative challenge. Instead of color, we focused on the interplay of patterns, textures, and silhouettes. This forced us to be incredibly meticulous in our costume design. Each detail—a bold geometric print, a luxurious velvet fabric, a sharply tailored cut—became a powerful tool to tell the story. In the end, the black-and-white palette pushed us to create a world with a unique visual language, one that is both elegant and deeply evocative.</p><h2 data-node-id=14 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>Where did you source costumes for Ripley? How much was purchased, or sourced, or vintage, versus how much was built or created?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Sourcing costumes for Ripley involved a multipronged approach. We aimed to create a world that felt authentic to the period while offering a fresh perspective.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">We scoured vintage stores and collectors for unique pieces that captured the essence of the era. These finds added a layer of authenticity and visual interest. However, due to the need for duplicates for some scenes, not all vintage pieces were viable options, and we used vintage mostly for extras.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">For almost all the main cast, we collaborated with tailors and costume makers to create bespoke pieces. This allowed us to achieve the perfect fit, style, and details that aligned with our vision. And certain wardrobe staples were sourced from established costume houses or reputable retailers. This ensured a foundation of high-quality garments that could be adapted or accessorized for different characters.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It’s difficult to provide an exact percentage breakdown, but we aimed to strike a balance between the unique character offered by vintage finds, the precision of custom creations, and the practicality of purchased staples.</p><img alt="ripley dakota fanning" title="ripley dakota fanning" width=1920 height=1080 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/ripley-n-s1-e7-00-14-06-17-6627e2a934e2a.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Courtesy of Netflix</span></p><h2 data-node-id=20 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>Were any pieces particularly difficult to get right?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">There were definitely some costume pieces that demanded extra attention! One standout was Dickie Greenleaf’s (played by Johnny Flynn) shoes. Re-creating those iconic loafers with all the intricate details in black-and-white was a fascinating challenge. We had to focus on the silhouette, the texture of the leather, and the subtle shine to capture their essence. Another interesting story involves Marge’s (Dakota Fanning) swimsuit. Finding the perfect one that conveyed her carefree spirit while translating well to black-and-white was tricky. We explored many options, ultimately landing on a design with a unique geometric pattern that pops onscreen and hints at her personality.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">But perhaps the biggest challenge was Tom Ripley’s entire wardrobe. In color, you can use clothing to showcase wealth, taste, or social status. In black-and-white, we had to rely on other details. Tom’s clothes often have subtle textural variations or interesting tailoring to suggest his background and differentiate him from the more affluent Dickie. It was a meticulous process, but one that ultimately helped define Tom’s character visually.</p><img alt="ripley andrew scott" title=RIPLEY width=3600 height=2400 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/ripley-ls-101-111621-03098-r-6627e49aa5887.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Netflix</span></p><h2 data-node-id=24 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>Are there details from any of the costumes that you’re especially proud of?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">There are definitely some costume details we are particularly proud of! One challenge was creating signature pieces for specific characters. Dickie’s ring and cuff links, for example, were meticulously designed and handcrafted especially for the show. Capturing the essence of the era in those bespoke pieces was a rewarding process. However, sometimes the most impactful details are more subtle. We were fortunate to discover a treasure trove of vintage fabrics from the ’50s. Sourcing these fabrics allowed us to create authentic costumes for the main cast. One specific detail I love is the use of a houndstooth pattern in silk. It’s a subtle nod to the era, and the black-and-white palette of the series allows the texture of the fabric to truly shine. It might go unnoticed by some viewers, but it adds a layer of authenticity that I find deeply satisfying.</p><h2 data-node-id=26 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>Dakota Fanning is an actress with incredible personal style. What was she like to work with?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">She is an absolute dream to work with! Her talent and dedication are matched only by her kindness and positive spirit. She definitely has a strong sense of personal style, and we had some fantastic conversations about how her character’s wardrobe could reflect that. Dakota was incredibly collaborative throughout the process. She always came prepared with thoughtful ideas about her character’s motivations and how clothing choices could express those. At the same time, she was incredibly open to our suggestions and loved exploring different options. There was a real sense of mutual respect and creative exchange, which ultimately led to some inspired costume choices for her character.</p><img alt="ripley dakota fanning" title=RIPLEY width=3600 height=2400 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/ripley-scm-102-021622-04409-r-6627e2cc603b0.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Stefano Cristiano Montesi</span></p><h2 data-node-id=29 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>Do you have a favorite fashion moment from Ripley the audience should watch out for?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">We relied heavily on details—a sharp geometric pattern hinting at personality, a luxurious fabric texture suggesting wealth, a contrasting silhouette creating unease. These details subtly evolve and interact with the story, creating a depth and intrigue we believe viewers will discover as they watch. We encourage viewers to pay close attention to how the costumes transform and interact with the story.…The intricate details woven into each piece add another layer of meaning to your viewing experience.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">This interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">MORE SCREEN STYLE</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/14c3069f-31a0-4f5a-9c90-463bf7712183_1703600547.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Todd Plummer" title="Headshot of Todd Plummer" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Todd Plummer is a Boston-based writer who covers style, entertainment, and travel.
