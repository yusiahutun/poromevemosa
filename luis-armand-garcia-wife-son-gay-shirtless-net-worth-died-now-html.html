He is best known for his role as the son, Max Lopez, in&nbsp;The&nbsp; George Lopez Show, that aired on&nbsp;ABC from 2002 to 2007. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-180 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p dir=ltr>His performance demonstrably awarded him with the highlights in the media. He also got nominated for a Young Artist Award. However, his personal life is wholly in the shadow.</p><p>Given his low profile life, no information regarding Luis' current involvement in any relationship has been revealed. However, he did have his share of romance in his teen years.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-181 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span>He once indulged in a romantic relationship with Tyra Taylor Simmons as a&nbsp;teen. Their relationship took a new step when they welcomed their son, Max. Parenting a child as a young couple was hard enough, so they could not focus on each other, for, as it seems, they&nbsp;found some differences which resulted in their silent break up.</p><p>He has not talked much about their relationship and has not disclosed any reasons for their separation. They <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">dated</a>&nbsp;back in 2006, but the break up followed shortly after. The relationship ended when Luis was just 16 years old.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite his low-profile dating life, we can't be sure if he is gay since he did go out with a girl once.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-183 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p></p><p><strong>Caption: Shirtless Luis Armand Garcia showing his chiseled body.</strong></p><p>Source:&nbsp;teenidols4you</p><p>As per the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">source</a>, after the cancellation of The George Lopez Show in 2007, Luis' MySpace suggested no probability of his return to the acting career.&nbsp;Before earning fame in the series, however, he appeared in a TV Commercial&nbsp;for Chevrolet.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-185 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span>After disappearing from the limelight, he made the headline once when the news of his arrest came out in 2012&nbsp;for being found drunk in public at a boisterous party.</p><p>His current status suggests distance from the spotlight. Moreover, he is not active on the social networking sites.&nbsp;Likewise, the former star has not disclosed his net worth.</p><p>We are affirmative that&nbsp;he has not died, but that he has merely kept his ongoing activities and whereabouts very confidential. We can be sure that he is a fully grown&nbsp;man and, hopefully, he is taking good care of his child, too. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-631 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_6"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmikmauys63MqaypZpOkunCxza2cq6yRnruusc2tZqWtmah6or7MmqWdZZeWv6S1wGauop6VYsCwuoygmLJlo522s8DLnqqsZZ6awW7DzquroWWUnrKlec2ormegpKK5</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./stylish-maternity-fashion.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Non-maternity fashion for pregnant women and to wear forever 2023">&larr;
