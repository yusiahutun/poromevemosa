Who is Danny Kilpatrick’s fiancée?</p><h2><strong>Introduction</strong></h2><p>Danny “KP” Kilpatrick is the man at the front and center of the VH1 reality television show, Black Ink Crew: Compton.</p><p>Kilpatrick got his come up as the proud owner of Compton’s first tattoo shop.</p><p>When the VH1 production team came calling, his business scored itself a spin-off of the successful Black Ink Crew franchise.</p><p>The show, which showcases the lives and careers of tattoo artists at the Black owned and operated tattoo shop, made its debut in August of 2019, and was renewed for a second season.</p><p>By the time the second season hit our screens in January 2022, KP and his crew were already experiencing unprecedented levels of exposure.</p><p>With that came the fans, and all the fans want to know more about the charismatic tattoo artist, businessman, musician, and artist.</p><p>So here’s what Danny Kilpatrick fans need to know.</p><h2><strong>The Origin Story</strong></h2><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-59319 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/danny-kilpatrick-kyla-pratt-wedding.jpg.webp alt="danny kilpatrick kyla pratt wedding" width=870 height=1200 sizes="(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 24px), 720px" data-pin-media=https://famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/danny-kilpatrick-kyla-pratt-wedding.jpg id=mv-trellis-img-1 data-svg=1 data-trellis-processed=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-59319 class=wp-caption-text>@Getty</p><p>Danny KP Kilpatrick was born on November 26, 1986. Born and raised in Compton by his mom, many of his friends and family could see early on that Danny was destined to be an artist.</p><p>When he was in the first grade, a teacher called his mom to tell her he was good at drawing.</p><p>That was it.</p><p>With standard kid-logic, Kilpatrick figured everyone was good at drawing, and he didn’t see his real potential until he got older.</p><p>When he hit his teen years at Compton’s Manuel Dominguez High School, football took over.</p><p>He was still drawing and creating music, but the appeal of having his name in the paper and people cheering him on was “a good feeling.”</p><p>Dominguez High School—the old high school of rap legend Eazy-E—opened a door for Kilpatrick that he hadn’t expected: he earned a college football scholarship.</p><p>He farewelled the high school football fame and headed to Lincoln College to major in art.</p><p>He also started writing rap around this time, and was selling weed to make some extra cash.</p><p>Then, when Danny was 19, he and some friends were pulled over by police in Florida.</p><p>Since being found in possession of drugs was his first offence, he didn’t have to worry about jail time—but he did lose his scholarship.</p><p>Less than a year into his college career, Kilpatrick was back living with his mother, with a probation officer checking his every move.</p><p>He was embarrassed for letting down his community, he had no income, and he needed to find a way out of his situation fast.</p><h2><strong>The Road to Stardom</strong></h2><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-59320 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/danny-kilpatrick-kyla-pratt-husband.jpg.webp alt="danny kilpatrick kyla pratt husband" width=870 height=1200 sizes="(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 24px), 720px" data-pin-media=https://famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/danny-kilpatrick-kyla-pratt-husband.jpg id=mv-trellis-img-2 data-trellis-processed=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-59320 class=wp-caption-text>@Getty</p><p>Where would we be without our friends? Danny Kilpatrick says he’d probably have landed in a “halfway house.”</p><p>While trying to figure out a way out of the mess he’d made of his potential, one of his friends had a suggestion.</p><p>He was like, “Man, you still draw? You can sell your artwork.”</p><p>This was the beginning of a whole new era for KP, who went from selling his actual drawings to creating prints and selling those.</p><p>Tattoos were big, too, and everyone in his neighborhood wanted one.</p><p>Danny purchased a tattoo kit and began practicing on his legs.</p><p>Quickly, he got good enough that people he knew would let him tattoo them.</p><p>One friend even agreed to let KP tattoo most of his body. “He was my walking canvas,” said the artist, remembering how he’d walk all over the neighborhood with his friend just advertising his work.</p><p>Orders for both his art and his tattoos started building up.</p><p>Kilpatrick wasn’t using stock art—he was personalizing every piece.</p><p>That level of dedication and workmanship would elevate Danny to the top of the tattoo community in Compton over the next decade.</p><p>It even brought in the celebrity clients—like Bad Boy Records exec Diddy, and Nas, arguably one of the best rappers of all time.</p><p>In 2018, when VH1 approached him with the Black Ink Crew spin-off, he jumped at the opportunity.</p><p>He opened a physical shop—Ink Art Music, and filming began. Season 2 of Black Ink Crew: Compton wrapped in the summer of 2022.</p><h2><strong>A Setback on Black Ink Crew: Compton</strong></h2><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-59321 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Danny-Kilpatrick-Net-Worth.jpg.webp alt="Danny Kilpatrick Net Worth" width=800 height=1200 sizes="(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 24px), 720px" data-pin-media=https://famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Danny-Kilpatrick-Net-Worth.jpg id=mv-trellis-img-3 data-trellis-processed=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-59321 class=wp-caption-text>@Getty</p><p>In the second season of the show, it became apparent that KP and his team had run into a major obstacle in the business.</p><p>Show producer Maricarmen Lopez explained to the crew that they had been having “issues with the permit office.”</p><p>The issue, it seemed, was that there was a no-tattoo shop ordinance in Compton.</p><p>Effectively, KP and the rest of his artists were not legally allowed to do tattoos there.</p><p>The show put a temporary focus on the cast members’ home lives as they worked through the red tape, but most fans were confident that with the relaxed restrictions post-2021, the show would be back to normal soon.</p><p><strong>READ MORE:</strong> <a href=#>Chris Gilpin Net Worth</a></p><h2><strong>The Family Man</strong></h2><p>Love walked into Danny’s life when he was possibly at his lowest point.</p><p>He had that probation officer and was dealing with the loss of a potential football career.</p><p>He had a drug charge on his record.</p><p>He was trying to get his career as a tattoo artist off the ground.</p><p>Then a girl came over to the house he shared with a couple of his cousins.</p><p>Not just any girl, either—she was Dr. Dolittle actress and Disney star Kyla Pratt.</p><p>The pair joked around over drinks, and after a heated debate over who could keep the “KP” name, Danny said:</p><p>“After that we was cool. That’s how we met.”</p><p>The pair have been together for over a decade, and have two children together: Lyric and Liyah.</p><p>Danny Kilpatrick and Kyla Pratt have not married yet. They got engaged in April 2011.</p><h2><strong>Danny Kilpatrick – Net Worth</strong></h2><p>So, how much is Danny Kilpatrick worth?
