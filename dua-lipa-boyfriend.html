Lipa, who is from London, entered the music scene in August 2015 with her debut single, “New Love.” She went on to release songs like “Be the One” and “Blow Your Mind (Mwah)” before her first number-one single in the United Kingdom, “New Rules,” in July 2017.</p><p>After that, Lipa’s career continued to rise with hits like “IDGAF” and “One Kiss” with Calvin Harris.” In March 2020, Lipa released her sophomore album, Future Nostalgia, which featured chart-topping tracks like “Don’t Start Now,” “Physical” and “<a href=# rel=noopener>Break My Heart</a>.” Lipa, who won the Grammy for Best New Artist in 2019, was also nominated in the Album of the Year category for Future Nostalgia at the 2021 Grammys.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Dua-Lipa-Grammys-2024.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Dua-Lipa-Trevor-Noah-Grammys-2024.jpg><p>With so much done in so little time, it’s hard to believe that Lipa found love amid all of her success.&nbsp;In an interview with Elle UK in 2018, Lipa opened up about why she’s always been a romantic. “I’m such a firm believer in love. I blame my parents for that because they have a really good relationship and I think they’ve set my standards high,” she said at the time. “Life is too not short not to say ‘I love you.’ As much as I tell myself not to rush into things or be careful to say ‘I love you’ too fast without really knowing if there’s any substance in the relationship, I think it’s really important to go with your gut.”</p><p>Still, though she’s always been a romantic, Lipa doesn’t look down on the times she’s been single.&nbsp; “When I’m single, I end up having so much more time to do a lot of other stuff,” she said. “I think you learn so much more about yourself when you’re completely alone and you have no one to go to for help for certain things. You learn to rely on yourself in a different way.”</p><p>So who is <a href=# id=auto-tag_dua-lipa data-tag=dua-lipa>Dua Lipa</a>‘s boyfriend and who has she dated in the past? Ahead is a look at Lipa’s dating history, from a Hadid brother to her first public relationship.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=callum-turner-2024-present>Callum Turner (2024 – present)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/callum-turner.jpg><p>Page Six reported that Dua Lipa is dating The Boys and The Boat actor Callum Turner. “It’s new, but but they’re mad about each other,” a source <a rel=nofollow href=# data-type=link data-id=https://pagesix.com/2024/01/11/entertainment/dua-lipa-is-dating-british-actor-callum-turner/>told the site.</a> Though she had no connection to Apple TV’s Masters of The Air which also stars Austin Butler and Barry Keoghan. “She was at the premiere to support him,” the source continued.</p><p>Days later they were <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://people.com/dua-lipa-callum-turner-kiss-during-los-angeles-date-night-8431064 rel=nofollow>photographed </a>leaving the famed paparazzi spot Sushi Park in Los Angeles.

She feels Romain totally gets it. They’re both really creative people.”</p><p>Romain dated fellow British singer Rita Ora in 2021. His reps confirmed to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">DailyMail,</a> “Rita and Romain split up months ago because of difficulties with their respective work commitments. They remain close friends.” A source close to Rita added: “Rita and Romain tried to make it work but they both agreed it wasn’t meant to be. ‘They remain close but it was simply impossible to maintain a relationship where they barely saw each other.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=jack-harlow-2022>Jack Harlow (2022)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Dua-Lipa-Jack-Harlow.jpg><p>News broke of Dua and Jack’s relationship in December 2022 when <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Page Six</a> reported that the two were dating after Dua’s breakup with <a href=# id=auto-tag_trevor-noah data-tag=trevor-noah>Trevor Noah</a>. The relationship came seven months after the release of Jack’s song, “Dua Lipa,” from his second album, Come Home the Kids Miss You, in May 2022. In the song, Jack raps that he’s “tryna do more with” Dua “than do a feature.” Jack confirmed in an interview on “The Breakfast Club” radio show at the time that he reached out to Dua and played her the song over FaceTime before he released it. “I wanted to get her blessing, so I FaceTimed her and played it for her because I didn’t want her to be blindsided by that or feel like creeped out or anything.” Jack said. “If she had said, ‘Yo, I hate it. I don’t want it to come out,’ it wouldn’t have come out.”</p><p>He continued, “Oh, I mean it’s not my song. I suppose it’s OK.’ She was just kinda thrown off and she just kinda let it go.” Jack added that he and Dua had since spoken since the call and their relationship was “less awkward.”</p><p>Dua and Jack met for the first time in person at the Variety Hitmakers Brunch in Los Angeles in December 2022. A source told Page Six in December 2022 that the two had been in “constant communication” since then. “He was very interested in her, and was going to strongly pursue [the romance],” the insider said. The site also reported that Jack flew to New York City to meet up with Dua after her Z100 Jingle Ball the Friday before their relationship went public. The two were also seen arriving separately at a restaurant in New York City’s Meatpacking District for lunch the next day. “He is going to do his best, as he has always been a fan of her,” a source told Page Six.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=trevor-noah-2022>Trevor Noah (2022)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Trevor-Noah-1.jpg><p>Dua and Trevor, the former host of The Daily Show, were first linked in September 2022 after The Daily Mail published <a href=# rel=noopener>photos of them on a date</a> at Miss Lily’s in New York City. The pictures came after Noah’s breakup with actress Minka Kelly in May 2022. “They were quietly sat away from everyone else at the restaurant. It was clear they were into each other and sat close together throughout the meal. They left together and walked, stopping for long embraces and on the second kiss with hugs,” a source told The Daily Mail.</p><p>Dua seemed to respond to the rumors in an interview on the “Dua Lipa: At Your Service” podcast in October 2022, where she confirmed she was single.“For me, this is the first year I’ve not been in a relationship for a very long time,” she said. “It’s been really great to just be alone and only think about myself and kind of be quite selfish, which I’ve never really had the opportunity to do. But when you find someone that really softens you and calms you down. I think it is the Leo thing—it makes a big difference.” <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Page Six</a> confirmed in December 2022 that Dua and Trevor’s relationship ended soon after their date at Miss Lily’s. “They haven’t spoken since,” the insider said.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=anwar-hadid-2019-2021>Anwar Hadid (2019 – 2021)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Anwar-Hadid-Dua-Lipa.jpg><p>Dua and <a href=# rel=noopener>Anwar</a> started dating in June 2019 after the “Don’t Start Now” split from her longtime boyfriend, Isaac Carew. According to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">TMZ</a>, Anwar’s sister, Gigi Hadid, who is friends with Dua, introduced them after Anwar told her that he’s a fan of the “Physical” singer’s music. The site reported July 2019 that Anwar asked Dua on a date after her breakup in June. After the date went well, Anwar invited Dua to his 20th birthday later that month and spent several days with him in Los Angeles before flying back to London, where she lived at the time.</p><p>The two were first photographed together at the British Summer Time Hyde Park music festival in London in July 2019, where they were seen kissing. According to TMZ, Dua and Anwar bonded over their love of music when they first started dating. (Anwar released his EP Bleach in 2020.)</p><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">British Vogue</a> in February 2021, Dua opened up about her relationship with Anwar and why the couple is “quite private” in real life despite their public affair on social media. “We have all these incredible memories and experiences, and if there’s something that we want to share together, then OK that’s fun,” she said. “But at the same time, we’re quite private — we’ll only show you as much as we want you to see.”</p><p>She continued, “It’s a little bit of give and take, trying to find the right balance of being so excited and being in love, and wanting to share that with the people around me, but at the same time not wanting to put too much out there. I want to be able to just be happy in this relationship without having other people’s opinions.”</p><p>In November 2021, <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">The Sun</a> reported that Dua and Anwar, who were known to “break up/get back together/break up/get back together,” were in “crisis.” “The couple floated the idea about putting the brakes on their romance last month as traveling so much and being apart is proving tough,” a source told The Sun at the time. “Their relationship is going through a crisis and appears to be on the rocks.”</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">People</a> confirmed <a href=# rel=noopener>Dua and Anwar’s breakup</a> a month later in December 2021. “Dua and Anwar are currently taking a break from their relationship and are spending time apart,” the insider said. “They’re figuring things out right now.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=isaac-carew-2013-2019>Isaac Carew (2013 – 2019)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Isaac-Carew-Dua-Lipa-1.jpg><p>Dua and Isaac, a model and a chef, dated on and off from 2013 to 2019. The two first split in early 2017, which is when Dua went on to date LANY lead singer Paul Klein. However, January 2018, Dua had broken up with Paul and reunited with Isaac. The two dated for another year before ending their relationship in June 2019.&nbsp;“Dua and Isaac have really struggled to see each other since getting back together,” a source told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">The Sun</a> at the time. “They wanted to make things work and things were great between them for a while but she is just getting busier and busier.”</p><p>The insider continued, “She is gearing up to release new music and has basically been performing across the world non-stop for the past three years so it’s been tough. It’s been a difficult decision but ultimately they haven’t been able to make things work.”</p><p>Their breakup came after rumors that Isaac had cheated on Dua after he was seen with another woman at London’s G-A-Y nightclub in 2018, according to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">The Sun</a>. The cheating rumors were never confirmed, however, fans believe that Dua and Isaac weren’t together at the time of the nightclub sighting.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=paul-klein-2017-2018>Paul Klein (2017 – 2018)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Paul-Klein.jpg><p>In between her breakups from Isaac, Dua dated LANY lead singer, Paul Klein. According to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">The Sun</a>, the two met at the British Summertime Festival in Hyde Park in July 2017 and even spent Christmas together in London in December. However, by January 2018, The Sun reported that Dua had broken up with Paul to reunite with her ex, Isaac. “Dua and Paul had a really good time together but things just didn’t work out,” a source said at the time. “She is very positive about the situation though, and has been pouring her emotions into her new album, which she has been writing in Jamaica and Los Angeles.</p><p>The insider continued, “The break-up has brought back memories of Isaac, who she split with this time last year. She has been messaging him again but she has been out of the country for the last few weeks so they haven’t seen each other.”</p><p>In 2018, LANY released their album, <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Malibu Nights</a>, which many believe to be about Paul’s relationship with Dua. In an interview with SCMP in 2020, Dua revealed that she hasn’t listened to her ex-boyfriend’s songs. “I haven’t really heard it,” she said.</p><p><span class=s1>Our mission at STYLECASTER is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do.
