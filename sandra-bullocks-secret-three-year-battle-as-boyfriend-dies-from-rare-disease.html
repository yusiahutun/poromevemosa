Their romance sparked after the model-turned-snapper was hired to photograph her son, Louis’ birthday party.

Rest in peace, Bryan.”</p><p>She then asked for donations to Massachusetts General Hospital and the ALS Association in his memory.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>“It’s just shocking”</h2><p>A friend of the snapper told the US Sun <a href=# rel=nofollow>they</a> were in “shock” over the news.</p><p>Mia St John, mom of Bryan’s ex partner Paris, said: “I’m just very sorry and in shock because I didn’t know he was sick.”</p><p>She continued that most people outside his inner circle were finding out about his tragic death from ALS in the news “just like everyone else”. This further shows Bryan and his family chose to deal with the rare disease privately.</p><p>Bryan, 57, and only two years younger than the Heat star was with Sandra for eight years.</p><p>Although he would attend some Red Carpet events with the actress, he shied away from the limelight.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmlwX2WFcL%2FAp5urmV2Xwq24zpyirGWjmrCzsdNmq6GqlZp6urHAq2SbmaSpuaZ5wKxkm6epm7%2Bqsc2dZJ2hlah6p77OpmSrmaKaeqW10p6YrJ1f</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./jessica-rabbit-plastic-surgery-instagram-19428758.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Small town girl spends 53,000 turning herself into real life Jessica Rabbit">&larr;
