While the name may make it sound exclusive, anyone can join. It can net you discounts, free LEGO sets, and other valuable rewards---so let's see how this works.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-is-lego-vip>What Is LEGO VIP?</h2><p>Put simply; LEGO VIP is a loyalty program for LEGO's customers. It rewards people for buying LEGO products through <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">LEGO.com</a>, following social media accounts associated with the company, or completing simple surveys. It's a pretty standard program for a company like LEGO to offer, but while the name makes it sound exclusive, you don't need to do anything special to sign up. All it takes is visiting the <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">LEGO VIP landing page</a> and pressing "Join," followed by the usual account creation if you don't already have one. LEGO will eventually send you a LEGO VIP card to take to stores, but you don't even need it. All you need is the email address you used to sign up.</p><h2 id=does-it-cost-anything>Does It Cost Anything?</h2><p>No, LEGO VIP is completely free---no subscription charges or sign-up fees here. The only thing you need is a LEGO ID. But this is also extremely simple to set up; just make an account on the LEGO site and you'll be good to go. However, this is a loyalty program, so while it may be free to sign up, you'll still have to spend a decent amount to get anything out of it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-it-does-for-you>What it Does for You</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/fcfb99c5.jpg> LEGO<p>Like many other loyalty programs, LEGO VIP rewards its members with VIP points that you exchange for various benefits. You gain points either through purchasing LEGO products off the LEGO website (or a physical LEGO store) or completing some of the other tasks we mentioned earlier like surveys. It's important to note that you can't get points from purchasing LEGO products at other stores like Amazon.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Once you've collected enough, you redeem points for coupons and other rewards found in the rewards center. This can include discounts on specific sets, gift cards for the website, tickets to the various LEGOLAND locations, or even small LEGO sets exclusively made for VIP members to claim for free. At the very least, VIP can save you a decent amount of money on your LEGO purchases. The rewards available change constantly, and physical items are always on a first-come, first-serve basis, so checking the VIP rewards page often is recommended to get the most out of your points.</p><p>Of course, you still have to save up enough points for these rewards, and how difficult that will depend on what you're after. The easiest way to earn points is by purchasing LEGO products (6.5 points per dollar spent on LEGO.com or in a LEGO store), but you will need to spend a decent amount to get anything notable. For example, a $20 off coupon for any LEGO set is&nbsp;2,600 points</p><p>---that's $400 worth of LEGO purchases. You have to be fairly invested in LEGO to acquire the fancier awards, of course, but there are less expensive options.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Those free VIP exclusive sets I mentioned earlier vary a lot in point requirements, depending on piece count, but they are usually in the 700-2,000 points range. Less valuable coupons obviously cost fewer points as well, so even if you don't spend a ton on LEGO, you can still snag some discounts. However, there are two more things you need to be aware of before engaging with this system.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/f2132836.jpg> LEGO<p>Some of the discounts found on the VIP rewards page&nbsp;</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>First off, 2X points events reward you with twice as many points for each purchase. These can apply sitewide during a month or be applied to specific sets/lines for a period of time, so this is another thing you'll have to check the LEGO VIP page for (or sign up for emails). If you're willing to plan your LEGO purchases around these, this is the best way to get the most out of LEGO VIP. On a more sour note, though, your points will expire if you go 18 months without purchasing the LEGO website or a physical store. It's a fairly generous time window, but it's unfortunate that points have to expire at all.</p><p>Besides points, another&nbsp;major benefit of VIP is early access, allowing VIP members to view and purchase certain LEGO sets before normal customers. Considering how quickly popular sets sell out nowadays, this is a fantastic way to get your foot in the door early. Of course, there's still a limited number of units available for early access, so it's no guarantee you'll get your hands on an upcoming set. Still, it's a nice bonus that anyone can access regardless of how much you've spent on LEGO.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>VIP also grants free add-on items and sets when purchasing specific LEGO products. We've seen a few examples of this, such as the <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">Yoda's Lightsaber</a> set that came for free with the <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">LEGO Star Wars Mos Eisley</a> set. This is just another way VIP members are rewarded for purchasing off LEGO.com and ensures you get the most out of your money.</p><h2 id=if-you-like-lego-then-sign-up-for-vip-now>If You Like LEGO, Then Sign-up for VIP Now</h2><p>No matter what level of LEGO fan you are or how much you have to spend on it, LEGO VIP is something you should sign up for---you're actively wasting money if you don't. It only takes a minute or two to sign-up for VIP if you already have a LEGO ID, and it's completely free, so there's really no downside. If you're a hardcore fan, you can strategize around 2X points events to score major rewards, but for more casuals users, the smaller discounts you can claim are always appreciated. Just remember, LEGO VIP solely works through LEGO.com, so you'll have to purchase all your sets from there if you're not already.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's worth noting this isn't the only way to get these sorts of discounts on LEGO sets. Retail stores like <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">Target</a> have their own loyalty programs you can sign up for that offer similar discounts, so you can still save even if you're shopping in person. This is far less reliable, though, when it comes to getting discounts on LEGOs specifically and lacks early access to new sets.</p><p>But if you're exclusively shopping on LEGO.com anyway, or want early access to LEGO's hottest sets, then VIP is a no-brainer and is something every fan of LEGO should sign up for.</p><h5 class=display-card-title>lego vip</h5><p class=display-card-description>LEGO's free loyalty program that grants discounts, early access to new sets, and other rewards.</p><a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow sponsored">Visit Now</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvWraagnZWge6S7zGhwbmhgZny4tMCtZKKrXaGyqLuMr6CpZZGjsW6%2Fx6ispZxdrry2ecmooKdn</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./things-to-do-after-installing-i3wm.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="9 Important Things to Do After Installing i3wm">&larr;
