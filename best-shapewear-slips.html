While they work as a second-skin base layer, critics of the slinky underclothing will voice concern: "How do I breathe in one?"; "They're just uncomfortable"; and, of course, "People still wear those?". The answer is yes, and if you're not convinced, CEO and Founder of Commando Kerry O'Brien calls them a timeless closet staple.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">"Slips are so misunderstood," the Commando Designer tells InStyle, "Not only does everything drape better with a slip, but they're essential if you want to preserve your favorite dress or skirt."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Slips became first widely worn towards the end of the 20th century, but there's nothing outdated about them: They've been entirely revitalized. The once-deemed old-school garment has transformed from layered chiffons with trim lining (Think: Grandma Core), and restrictive shapewear, into breathable fabrics and eye-catching silhouettes <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>that double as dresses.</a> They also offer more <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>size-inclusive options and skin-matching tones </a>than ever before, which is part of the reason the Skims Fits Everybody Slip Dress takes our #1 spot.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">That said: with so many new options, it's hard to know where to begin. Happen to be ready to invest in your first line of defense in creating a capsule wardrobe? We've got you covered — literally.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-skims-fits-everybody-slip-dress></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Overall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Skims Fits Everybody Slip Dress</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="SKIMS Fits Everybody Slip Dress " style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/tjgJC1dmcQv-kkHHXrNnOO7Y8ps=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/skims-fits-everybody-slip-dress-f9d99e87c9af4e1bab8f9eba4d5475e2.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>SKIMS</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It's comfortable enough to be loungewear, but compressing enough to be shapewear.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love:</strong> It's not double lined, so it might be see-through depending on the colorway you choose.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This piece does many things right, starting with being appropriately named. The Skims "Naked Slip" literally feels like you're wearing nothing when it's on. (It's also worth mentioning that it's available in nine different skin-tone shades, adding to the nakedness.) The camisole has a buttery fabric that is soft to the touch and feels even smoother on the body. And while the silhouette accentuates your figure, it's (surprisingly) comfortable. This timeless garment puts typical shapewear myths to rest: you don't have to shimmy to get into it, you won't find yourself constantly pulling it down, and you won't even need to wear a bra. Check, check, and check. With the right mix of comfortability and compression in a slip, it earns our no. one spot as Best Overall.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Price at time of publish: $62</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> XXS-4XL | <strong>Fit: </strong>True to size | <strong>Colors: </strong>14 | <strong>Length: </strong>Mini | <strong>Material: </strong>Nylon, spandex</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-value-jockey-generation-womens-full-slip></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Value</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Jockey Generation Women's Full Slip</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1388 data-sizes=750px alt="Jockey Generation Women's Full Slip" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/wu91QmnakYTxb_ER__OqlorKctI=/fit-in/1500x1388/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Screenshot2023-03-24at5.06.43PM-d055c34f594344cfbbf8b170dee4c8b3.png"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Courtesy of Target</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:&nbsp;</strong>It's lightweight, breathable, and won't show under clothes even though it's not form-fitting.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love:</strong>&nbsp;The slip can run a little small.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For an item meant to act as camouflage, your wallet will definitely notice the difference while shopping for these undergarments. Many on the market run you a pretty penny, but Jockey makes a more affordable option that, despite costing half the price as others, feels luxurious against your skin. This slip dress is so comfy it's easy to forget you're wearing one, and you can take advantage of the breathable fabric as sleepwear, too.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While it won't cling to your body, the slip layers seamlessly under clothes and doesn't appear bulky against lighter fabrics, like a sundress. We still recommend sticking to your original size if you're looking for a tighter fit because it runs small.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Price at time of publish:&nbsp;$18</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:&nbsp;</strong>S – XL |&nbsp;<strong>Fit:&nbsp;</strong>Runs small |&nbsp;<strong>Colors:&nbsp;</strong>2 |&nbsp;<strong>Length:&nbsp;</strong>Mid-thigh |&nbsp;<strong>Material:&nbsp;</strong>Nylon, spandex</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-plus-size-knix-luxelift-slip></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Plus-Size</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Knix LuxeLift Slip</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Knix LuxeLift Slip" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/rk3meF3n7DWp9oReRht0KfuuQgk=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/knix-luxelift-slip-20e0a5fff13845c386ed01a13cf12de5.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Knix</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>Sizes go from S to XXXL+, so this dress offers something for everyone.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love:</strong> The length might feel long, especially if you're petite in height.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Knix CEO and Founder Joanna Griffiths took a risk when she transitioned her lingerie brand from wholesale to 100% online when traditional retailers didn't carry such an expansive size assortment — and the decision paid off. The first time I saw the Knix brand was on TikTok, and I was intrigued by how bouncy their product fabric seemed in videos. After testing it out myself, I'm here to confirm those raw cut edges look just as satisfying in person as they do online.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This size-inclusive slip is a smooth, versatile garment that includes interior grippers and adjustable straps for functionality. The sleek undergarment also features a built-in bra with removable cups, catering to the body wearing it in more ways than just one.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Price at time of publish: $64</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> S–XXXL+ | <strong>Fit: </strong>True to size | <strong>Colors: </strong>6 | <strong>Length:</strong> Mid-thigh | <strong>Material: </strong>Nylon, spandex</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-strapless-slip-tc-convertible-strapless-slip></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Strapless Slip</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>TC Convertible Strapless Slip</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1220 data-sizes=750px alt="TC Convertible Strapless Slip" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/Q3iZnGc4qS96CJarNgxgfs-Zn9A=/fit-in/1500x1220/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Screenshot2023-03-24at5.10.17PM-ad66287f8f8243f6ab729b6460d58630.png"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Courtesy of Nordstrom</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:&nbsp;</strong>The comfortable strapless slip won't slide down or ride up thanks to rubber grippers on the edges.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love:</strong>&nbsp;It only comes in one color.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Anyone whose worn an ill-fitting strapless bra knows the feeling of finding it somewhere around your waist mid-day. Instead of an uncomfortable underwire, TC gives you clearance to go strap-free by using a rubber gripper in the bodice and hemline to ensure slippage isn't an issue. Throw on that strapless LBD or bodycon dress because the nearly seamless design disguises itself under form-fitting fabrics. It also includes a tummy control panel to keep you slightly snug and comes with the insurance of convertible straps if you need extra support. We love that the opaque fabric won't show what we're wearing underneath, but we hope the brand expands the line soon to include additional colors.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Price at time of publish:&nbsp;$59</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:&nbsp;</strong>XS–XL |&nbsp;<strong>Fit:&nbsp;</strong>Runs small |&nbsp;<strong>Colors:&nbsp;</strong>1 |&nbsp;<strong>Length:&nbsp;</strong>Mid-thigh |&nbsp;<strong>Material:&nbsp;</strong>Nylon, spandex</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-slip-for-that-naked-look-nubian-skin-naked-full-slip></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Slip for that "Naked" Look</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Nubian Skin Naked Full Slip</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Nubian Skin Naked Full Slip" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/4hL2d0uKapV97THe-5AnW3NnWos=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Nubian-Skin-Naked-Full-Slip-b4541c86789846a69905bbc860b355f3.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Nubian Skin</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> Their website offers a "skin tone" guide, and it accurately matches your slip to your foundation color.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love:</strong> It runs small, so it might fit a bit snug in your regular size.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Slips might be known as a "second-skin" layer, but most brands don't offer a wide range of custom-dyed colorways like the innovative, black-owned brand, Nubian Skin. "My nude isn't the nude I see in shops," <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow nocaes">wrote Founder Ade Hassan about her brand</a>. "Despite the reality that women of color have the same needs as all women when it comes to lingerie and hosiery, the industry simply doesn't cater to us." Her mission was to redefine "nude."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Their "Naked Full Slip" makes our list as a silky base layer that is comfortable and blends beautifully with skin tones. Stylist Kyanna Johnson tells InStyle that she needs a variety of options for clients, so that's exactly why Nubian Skin is her go-to. "With a wide range of colors and styles, it allows my clients to feel comfortable and confident in any look."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Price at time of publish: $80</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>XS–XXL | <strong>Fit: </strong>True to size | <strong>Colors: </strong>4 | <strong>Length: </strong>Knee-length | <strong>Material: </strong>Polyamide, elastane</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-splurge-wolford-individual-nature-forming-dress></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Splurge</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Wolford Individual Nature Forming Dress</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1396 data-sizes=750px alt="Wolford Individual Nature Forming Dress" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/byanV4gqfN8poOw7FJ1hTDr2Swc=/fit-in/1500x1396/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Screenshot2023-03-28at2.23.18PM-418f36e7345b4997b04e6cc9c9ea7451.png"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Courtesy of Wolford</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> The fabric is stretchy, lightweight, and luxurious.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> There are only two color choices.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Let's be honest: Compared to a new purse or makeup palette, buying shapewear isn't the most exciting purchase in the world. If you want to limit the number of times you're in the underwear aisle, Wolford creates a beautiful, long-lasting shapewear dress that you'll reach for time and time again. (There's a reason why Blair Waldorf always praised Wolford in the TV drama Gossip Girl: This brand knows how to make quality undergarments.) It lightly compresses you, and as much as <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>corsets are having their moment</a>, doesn't feel too tight. We love the lightweight material of this dress, which allows it to easily lay undetected underneath clothing, while it also gently shapes the body with a bit of compression. The fabric might seem delicate, but thanks to wide straps and lots of stretch, it will hold up well, offering you coverage and support down to the mid-thigh, just as long as you wash it correctly (machine wash on cold and lay it flat to dry, basically). We only wish this came in more colors.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Price at time of publish: $205</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> XS–XL | <strong>Fit:</strong> True to size | <strong>Colors</strong>: 2 | <strong>Length:</strong> Mid-thigh | <strong>Material:</strong> Polyamide, elastane</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-slip-that-can-double-as-a-dress-parade-smoothing-slip-dress></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Slip That Can Double As A Dress</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Parade Smoothing Slip Dress</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=902 data-sizes=750px alt="Parade Smoothing Slip Dress" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/OMpjQ_G2BODDS1MVJYRsaH0Tlbk=/fit-in/1500x902/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Screenshot2023-03-28at2.28.08PM-93abf02a727847e69819df034a60a47d.png"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Courtesy of Parade</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> It offers multiple ways to wear it.

We have our eyes on this slip, for instance, because unlike some of the items on this list, it's thin enough to be worn underneath other garments but sturdy enough to double as a night-out dress — talk about multifunctional. Just look at its features: the nylon-elastane blend equals a silky fabric for smoothing; the scoop neckline shows off the decolletage; and the adjustable straps offer extra support. Essentially, these are all the important wants and needs of a slip that can do more than what it's marketed for. It helps that the dress is available in six contrasting shades and a range of sizes to cater to multiple body types. And for the under $20 price point, we consider this a solid deal. It comes in mainly fun colors — another reason why we say you should definitely wear this out on its own — so there’s more of a chance it’ll show underneath clothing, depending on the color and weight of the fabric.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Price at time of publish: $18</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> XS–3XL | <strong>Fit:</strong> True to size, fitted | <strong>Colors</strong>: 6 | <strong>Length:</strong> Low to mid thigh | <strong>Material:</strong> Recycled nylon, elastane</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-slip-to-wear-underneath-sheer-clothing-numi-the-shelf-bra-slip></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Slip to Wear Underneath Sheer Clothing</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Numi The Shelf Bra Slip</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=978 data-sizes=750px alt="Numi The Shelf Bra Slip" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/uoBVYMEcpzBQUVtgg7liqLwB-KU=/fit-in/1500x978/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Screenshot2023-03-28at2.31.30PM-1967a23a564c404fb743bc769008afdd.png"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Courtesy of Numi</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> The slip is figure-hugging, so it is seamless underneath clothing.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> The built-in bra might not be supportive enough for large chests.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We all know Gen-Z loves a Y2K trend, and with stars like Dua Lipa and Vanessa Hudgens sporting sheer clothing, we expect this is another one planning to stay in the 21st century. But if you're not ready to go all-in by <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>showing everything underneath</a>, this versatile slip dress is your solution. Because it is designed to be figure-hugging, the finish of the slip is smooth and practically invisible. Yet, the silky fabric, which wicks away moisture, helps it mold and move with you, too. The bonus built-in shelf bra also means you don’t have to worry about your bra straps and clasp peaking through — you can just enjoy the coverage and supportive benefits instead.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Price at time of publish: $85</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> XS–XL | <strong>Fit:</strong> True to size | <strong>Colors</strong>: 2 | <strong>Length:</strong> Mid-thigh | <strong>Material:</strong> Tencel, lycra</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-half-slip-commando-half-slip></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Half Slip</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Commando Half Slip</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Commando Half Slip" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/BwINVPaC2ss5jVEF09bx1NQ_nfU=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/commando-4ed13f76b19047a199b7d4e380ee5ea9.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Commando</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> It stays in-place and doesn’t bulge.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> The sizing options are limited.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-45 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Half slips are an underrated option if you’re seeking for extra twirl from your skirt. Having this extra layer underneath loose, satin, or form-fitting skirts lessens the amount of uncomfortable clinging to crevices so you’re left with a seamless look. But if you don’t know where to look, this half skirt from Commando is a solid option. It is uniquely designed to lie flat against the body thanks to its patented weight system. The invisible edges across the hems and seams keep it in place and minimize any bulging, so you’d don’t have to worry about it riding up or showing any panty lines. We hope they expand the sizing options, though, soon, since the offerings right now won’t fit all body sizes.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-46 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Price at time of publish: $58</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-47 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> S/M–M/L | <strong>Fit:</strong> True to size | <strong>Colors</strong>: 2 | <strong>Length:</strong> Mid-thigh | <strong>Material:</strong> Nylon, spandex</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-slip-shorts-jockey-generation-womens-wicking-slip-short></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Slip Shorts</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Jockey Generation Women’s Wicking Slip Short</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1122 data-sizes=750px alt="Jockey Generation Women&amp;acirc;s Wicking Slip Short" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/tobQZWxDKpvCS9oEbPwSKruxWnY=/fit-in/1500x1122/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Screenshot2023-03-28at2.40.19PM-a7478978515b4da58559e85b62945ed3.png"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Courtesy of Target</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> Provide the right amount of coverage with no constriction to the waist and thighs.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> They roll down around the waist.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-50 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">To decrease any potential thigh chafing or accidental Marilyn Monroe moments, a pair of slip shorts will be a handy addition to your closet. And they even add an extra layer of comfort, especially thanks to the microfiber material that has moisture-wicking abilities on this Jockey pair. These shorts also won’t leave lines around the thighs because they’re not meant to be compressive, just an extra layer, but keep in mind that they do tend to roll down at the waist when you bend over.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-51 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Price at time of publish: $14</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-52 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> S–3X | <strong>Fit:</strong> True to size | <strong>Colors</strong>: 2 | <strong>Length:</strong> Mid-thigh | <strong>Material:</strong> Polyester, nylon, spandex, cotton</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-v-neck-den-short-deep-v-neck-slip></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best V-Neck</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Dôen Short Deep V-Neck Slip</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1362 data-sizes=750px alt="D&amp;Atilde;&amp;acute;en Short Deep V-Neck Slip" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/3WEASO5juCUtIJvxyZc1vjPGTFk=/fit-in/1500x1362/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Screenshot2023-03-28at2.45.34PM-d57d3a9b60224194b1b453fce0ca284d.png"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Courtesy of DÃ´en</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> The deep v-neck accommodates lower cut and button-up dresses.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> It will only work for flouncy dresses, so if you have a more figure-hugging option, this might bulge underneath.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-55 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Most of the options on this list have a scoop, sweetheart, or straight neckline, which won’t accommodate your lower cut and button-up dresses as much as we might wish they did. So opt for a deep v-neck slip instead, like this one from Dôen, which will fully solve the issue. It does the job of a slip to provide you additional coverage for your dresses, yet it still manages to keep your cleavage showing through (and avoids any dreaded uniboob action). Adjust the straps depending on the deepness of your garment’s cut, and enjoy the flowy-ness of the fabric’s sheer material. We can’t see this working with a fitted dress because the fabric won’t hug your body. But you’ll still get plenty of wear out of it because we can see the slip being worn as a sexy lingerie piece, too.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-56 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Price at time of publish: $46</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-57 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> XXS–2X | <strong>Fit:</strong> True to size | <strong>Colors</strong>: 5 | <strong>Length:</strong> Mini to mid-thigh | <strong>Material:</strong> Viscose</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-long-free-people-tea-length-seamless-slip></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Long</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Free People Tea Length Seamless Slip</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1332 data-sizes=750px alt="Free People Tea Length Seamless Slip" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/RIgKI8C76HgpajMDJSBL3eMkmlg=/fit-in/1500x1332/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Screenshot2023-03-28at2.49.36PM-32d2de494b5d4599a4d9d3c32747fc2c.png"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Courtesy of Free People</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> Works well underneath midi to longer length dresses.

Just look at the color options, too: there are seven shades to choose from – black, a mossy green, and light pink, to name a few — for endless outfits. We especially love the stretchy and body-conscious fit throughout, which contours your body without feeling too snug, so it moves with you and not the other way around.

Take this piece from Intimissimi, for instance: It’s crafted from 100 percent silk (which means it doesn’t sacrifice comfort), and is offered in three timeless shades: black, white, and a light pink. The simplicity of the slip with the luxurious fabric make it a sophisticated option for day and night, whether on its own or with a dress on top. And the adjustable, skinny straps are perfect to hide under wider straps, and offer extra support and/or coverage around the cleavage. All of that just sounds like a whole lot of comfort, if you ask us.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-67 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Price at time of publish: $89</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-68 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> S – L | <strong>Fit:</strong> True to size | <strong>Colors</strong>: 3 | <strong>Length:</strong> Mini&nbsp; | <strong>Material:</strong> Silk</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-to-keep-in-mind></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What to Keep In Mind</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Fabric</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">According to Commando CEO Kerry O'Brien, "the best slip, should slip." What does she mean by that? She means the fabric. It should drape easily on the skin, without the typical conundrums of a badly constructed slip. It should never cling to the wearer. She says to point to microfibers that have a "second-skin feel on the body" which prevents static and can be raw cut. Combos of elastane (spandex) and polyamide (nylon) will also do the job.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Care</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">O'Brien also points to specific care instructions on the garment. "The better you care for your slip, the better — and longer — it will do its job," she tells InStyle. Most high-quality slips will need to be machine washed in cold water (no bleach!) and drip-dried to preserve shape. "Slips are in high rotation in my wardrobe, and I promise once you start wearing one, you'll want to wear them all the time." So, the easier it is to take care of them, the more you can wear them.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-your-questions-answered></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Your Questions, Answered</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Do you wear a bra underneath a slip?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Whether you wear a bra underneath a slip comes down to your personal preference and what you feel comfortable with, says O'Brien.

First, high-quality fabrics that don't cling or ride up, will keep the garment invisible. Look for raw cut hems and body-shaping fabrics like Spandex and Nylon (see above). A good slip will feel smooth. An even better slip will appear smooth. Second, the lengths of slips are something to look out for when trying to hide the undergarment. Make sure the slip resembles the silhouette of your dress/outerwear. Sometimes hemlines can be tricky.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Oh, also never wear white under black clothing – but you already knew that.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-why-shop-with-us></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Why Shop With Us<br></span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Morgan Sullivan</a> is a freelance writer based out of Philadelphia, covering all scopes of fashion and beauty for InStyle.
