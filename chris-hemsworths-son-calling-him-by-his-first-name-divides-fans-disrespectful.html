Chris and his family are currently enjoying themselves on holiday in the beautiful setting. As they are laughing and joking around, the <a href=#>Hollywood</a> actor’s son calls him a nickname which some fans disagreed with and took to the comments to tell him so, but the actor was quick to respond to the backlash.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-chris-hemsworth-shares-son-s-nickname-for-him>Chris Hemsworth shares son’s nickname for him</h2><p>Sharing a video of himself and Tristan on a chartered boat as they fished in the Fiji waters, <a href=#>Chris Hemsworth’s</a> son can be heard calling him by the quite unusual nickname ‘Chris.’</p><p>Writing about the quality time he was spending with his little one, the <a href=#>celebrity</a> captioned the post: “My son wanted to catch a fish for the locals in Fiji and after 3 attempts and about 12 hrs at sea we pulled in this beauty. Fed the village for 3 days.”</p><p>Tristan encourages his dad as the 40-year-old reels in a catch: “C’mon Chris. Keep on fighting it. Don’t let [go].”</p><p><strong>MORE:</strong> <a href=#>Drake naming his pet cat Crodie wasn’t on fans’ bingo card</a></p><p>“I’m fighting it bro,” Chris responds, seemingly struggling to bring in what he’s caught.</p><p>However, the fact his son called him by his name rather than dad has rubbed some people the wrong way. Some have even gone as far as to label it “disrespectful.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-fans-say-tristan-is-wrong-for-calling-his-dad-chris>Fans say Tristan is wrong for calling his dad Chris</h2><p>One person wrote: “Disrespect calling your father by his name at that age. I have always heard Chris call his father dad.”</p><p>Another penned: “Nah the son calling his dad by Chris is weird.”</p><p>A third said: “It’s sad he doesn’t call you dad. Being a dad is special. Friend… he will have tonnes of friends all his life and only one dad. Besides, it is more meaningful and respectful.”</p><p>A fourth commented: “Why is his son calling him Chris” before adding a thinking face emoji.</p><p>However, others have defended the pair, saying as long as Chris Hemsworth is fine with his son calling him by his name, it shouldn’t bother others.</p><p>“I feel it’s just a banter moment between them. Nothing serious,” wrote one person.</p><p>“If Chris doesn’t find it disrespectful how is it disrespectful? [exploding head emoji]” questioned someone else</p><p>A third wrote: “He isn’t your child so why does it matter and impact you?”</p><p>Others pointed out that it may be an “Aussie thing” as Australians were quick to say they call their parents by their first name. One Australian native penned: “My 5-year-old daughter calls her dad by his name, most of the time, I call my mum and dad by their names, might be an Aussie thing.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-we-re-best-friends>‘We’re best friends’</h2><p>In his caption, Chris Hemsworth defended the nickname that Tristan had given him. Perhaps the star was hoping to quash the heated debates in his comments, declaring he and his son were “mates.”</p><p>The <a href=#>movie</a> star wrote: “Ps if you’re wondering why my son calls me Chris it’s because I’m his BFF and true mates don’t call each other dad.”</p><p>Really, it’s a sweet reason they have that close relationship.</p><p><strong>MORE: </strong><a href=#>Frankie Muniz managed to escape the dark side of Hollywood despite being huge child star</a></p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmpqX2aGcK%2FHq6CsZZiaurTDzquroatdqLyvecKao6Whnpx6qbXMZpmyZZiewG6yyKuqrWWelrqmecOiraKclah6p63NrGSdoaOnsrS8xJyrn62cZA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./646031faca4741de218b458e-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Elon Musk bes a un robot?
