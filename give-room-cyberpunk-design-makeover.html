Read them; slowly. Let your mind wander deep, then come back here. You'll thank me. For the rest of us, be kind to the newcomer. They've been living in our world all along and have only come to realize it now. They are our kin.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/sleep-dealer-03.jpg><p>Because of the digital nature of cyberpunk and our lives today, it's no surprise people are making their own worlds match the fantasy. It could be their home office, gaming room, or even home theater room. All of these rooms lend themselves well to this kind of DIY interior design.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=elements-of-cyberpunk-interior-design>Elements of Cyberpunk Interior Design</h2><p>The cyberpunk aesthetic can be broken down into three main types:&nbsp;minimalist, chaotic, and retro-futuristic. Before you go saying that there's more types than that, consider that most scenes in any cyberpunk game or movie are, at least, some combination of those. Blending in elements of Asian or even Ancient Egyptian culture is also often seen. You might call it a pan-cultural look as well.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/ex-machina-013-narrow.png><p>In all three of those types, there are some common elements: electronics, glossy and matte colors with a sparse palette, repetitive geometric patterns, metal, glass, ambient lighting and automation. Lots of ambient lighting and <a title="6 Types of Home Automation You Can Actually Afford" href=#>home automation</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>These elements seem so common but are used in vastly different ways within the design types. Let's take a look at each type, and a few real world examples in real people's homes.</p><h2 id=the-minimalist-cyberpunk-room>The Minimalist Cyberpunk Room</h2><p>Great cinematic and gaming examples of the minimalist design can be found everywhere. Pick a cyberpunk movie, think of where the rich people or villains lived, and that's typically your minimalist cyberpunk room. One example is Flynn's safe room in Tron: Legacy.</p><p>Before you go off on me saying Tron isn't cyberpunk, think about this; in plenty of cyberpunk stories, people <a title="Biohacking: The Creepy but Exciting Trend in Body Modification" href=#>inject technology into themselves</a>. In Tron, they inject themselves into the technology.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/tron-flynns-safehouse-640.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Flynn's room inspired TheRPF.com user gdspy to design and <a title="Tron Inspired Bedroom" href=#>build a Tron safe-room of their own</a>. Using some impressive woodworking skills, and creative lighting techniques, the effect is astounding. Take a look through gdspy's post and you can see the techniques they used. Remember to <a title="8 Stunning Cyberpunk Costume Ideas with LEDs" href=#>make some wicked cyberpunk light-up costumes</a>, and wear it&nbsp;for full effect.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/gdspys-flynn-room.png><p>If you're lucky enough to get featured on a reality home makeover show with a big budget, you could end up with this Tron-inspired bedroom. It comes complete with video projector, computer station, luminescent bed spread and a Tron-cycle. Go full punk and <a title="Build a Smartphone Projector From An Old Shoebox" href=#>build your own video projector</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Another source of inspiration for the clean cyberpunk look has been the <a title="Official Portal 2 Website" href=#>Portal games</a>. Again, purists might say this isn't cyberpunk. Like I said before; <a title="9 Beautifully Pointless Wikipedia Edit Wars You Need to Know About" href=#>Internet holy wars</a>. Trying to defeat an evil tech company and teleportation are huge tropes in the cyberpunk world. So get over it and check out these two amazing Portal inspired rooms.</p><p>First up is the Ultimate Portal Bedroom [Broken URL Removed] created by Randy Slavey and featured at GeekDad.com. Using his DIY skills, some sweet rope lights, a few <a title='NECA Valve Portal Prop Replica "Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device" Customizable Kit' href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">Portal&nbsp;collectibles</a>, and lots of paint and patience, Slavey gave his son a bedroom worthy of any Aperture employee's kid.

Think poor cable management and bad electronics storage. Everything is tinged with gray and rust. Ambient lighting leaks from monitors everywhere. You might see old quasi-Asian advertising signs, or totalitarian propaganda. This isn't the clean ultramodern room. Expect to find old tech repurposed&nbsp;to do new things.</p><p>Rick Deckard in Blade Runner has the prototypical grungy cyberpunk apartment. Oddly enough, much of its interior design was inspired by famed architect <a title="Ennis House" href=#>Frank Lloyd Wright's Ennis House</a>. Odd, because it&nbsp;was built in 1924. But it shouldn't be too surprising, since it was also used for other 'dark' films such as <a title="The Thirteenth Floor" href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">The Thirteenth Floor</a> and <a title="Black Rain - Michael Douglas Andy Garcia Kate Capshaw" href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">Black Rain</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Ennis_House_front_view_2005.png><p>If you're trying to achieve a similar look, try your hand&nbsp;at 3D printing and mold making. You can <a title="3D Printing File for Blade Runner Ennis House Tile" href=#>download&nbsp;a file to 3D print the Blade Runner Ennis House tile</a> and then watch the video below to see one way to make a mold from it. Then you can cast as many tiles as you want in concrete or plaster. Just make sure to paint them a dreary gray for authenticity.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Deckard's apartment is likely the most well documented cyberpunk space, ever. A bunch of folks over at PropSummit spent the better part of year documenting <a href=#>every item in Deckard's apartment</a>, often finding the real-world equivalents. For a more visual exposé, check out Interiorator's collection of apartment screen shots from the Blade Runner.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Bladerunner-Interiors-0002.png><p>If that's not enough, how about a 3D walkthrough of Deckard's apartment? Software engineer Quentin Lengelé has created a series of these virtual reality walkthroughs. You can even pop on your <a title="5 Oculus Rift Gaming Experiences That Will Blow You Away" href=#>Oculus Rift</a> and experience it&nbsp;yourself over at the BR9732.com website.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When you do build your Blade Runner room, make sure to set up your <a title="How To Make Your Raspberry Pi Into a Home Theater System" href=#>DIY Raspberry Pi home theater system</a> on a loop of 12 hours of ambient sounds from Deckard's apartment.</p><p>For real-life&nbsp;chaotic cyberpunk interior design, check out&nbsp;a <a title="Maker Space in Germany Called C-Base" href=#>maker space in Germany called C-Base</a>.

Fair enough.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/c-base-collage.png><p>Another beautiful feature of this space&nbsp;is that it's highly functional.
