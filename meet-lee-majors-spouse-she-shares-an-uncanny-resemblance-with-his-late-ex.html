He was one of those people who held down regular jobs before fame found them.&nbsp;</p><p>Indeed, before he became a Hollywood staple in his 30s, Lee worked as a park recreation director for the City of Los Angeles.&nbsp;He enjoyed moderate fame following his roles in “The Big Valley” and “The Fall Guy.” However, his breakout role came after he starred as Steve Austin in “The Six Million Dollar Man.”</p><p>Since then, Lee has maintained a steady presence on the big screens, and he has many awards to show for it. But unfortunately, the actor did not enjoy the same success in his marriage.&nbsp;</p><p>He got married four times to different women. Aside from Faith, the other women Lee married include Kathy Robinson, Farrah Fawcett, and Karen Velenz.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/flee-fotor-202308211668-656x1024.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Is_Lee_Majors_Spouse></span>Who Is Lee Majors’ Spouse?&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Lee Majors is currently married to Faith Majors. The pair have a wide age gap, with Lee leading her at about 45 years.&nbsp;Of course, age is just a number to the couple, which is not enough to jeopardize what they found in each other that has made their marriage last this long.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2019, Lee joked that his decades-long union with Faith was a “record in Hollywood” and that he was proud to be her husband for as long as he has been.&nbsp;As far as they are both concerned, theirs is a beautiful love story, and with evidence clearly defined in their bond, who can argue differently?&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_Did_Lee_Majors_Spouse_Meet_Him></span>How Did Lee Majors’ Spouse Meet Him?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Faith and Lee ran into each other at a friend’s dinner party in Florida. Their first contact had Lee, who was regarded as macho because of his challenging guy role, reverting to teenagehood.&nbsp;</p><p>According to him, the first time he saw Faith, he could not approach her and had to get his friend to collect her digits.&nbsp;Faith graciously agreed to let Lee have her number, and he asked her to join him for the 1995 Super Bowl. She suggested they have lunch first to get to know one another, but ultimately went to the Superbowl with him.&nbsp;</p><p>Faith <a href=#>said</a>: “[Lee] has a heart of gold. And that was it; the rest is history.”</p><p>The pair dated for two years before they decided to take the next step. By the second year, Lee was convinced he had found the one, and he gave his reasons in one interview.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/leemaj-fotor-2023082116448.jpg><p>He said: “I found a lovely young lady, and she’s helped me with my kids, and they love her.”</p><p>More than two decades have passed since they tied the knot. However, these two lovebirds still feel the same about each other as they did in their early days.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Lee_Majors_Current_Wife_Shares_an_Uncanny_Resemblance_to_His_Late_Ex-Wife></span>Lee Majors’ Current Wife Shares an Uncanny Resemblance to His Late Ex-Wife<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Not long after it was confirmed that Lee Majors and Faith were an item, their fans realized one curious little detail — Faith looked eerily similar to Farrah Fawcett, his second wife.&nbsp;</p><p>It makes one wonder if their uncanny looks are not one of the things that got Lee interested in Faith in the first place.&nbsp;Fawcett was Lee’s second wife. He met her through his publicist, and their relationship started when he took Fawcett for a coffee.&nbsp;</p><p>Lee once <a href=#>said</a>: “So that started that. It was swift, and it lasted about almost 12 years.”&nbsp;</p><p>The actor and the late actress bonded over their Southern roots and passion for sports. Then got married in 1973, the same year he landed his breakout role as Steve Austin.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_Happened_Between_Lee_Majors_and_Farrah_Fawcett></span>What Happened Between Lee Majors and Farrah Fawcett?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The popularity Lee’s marriage to Farah Fawcett won him was used well. Not only did it boost his fame, but he also used it to help Fawcett land some roles. Three years later, she landed her breakout role in “Charlie’s Angels,” launching her into true stardom.&nbsp;</p><p>Not long after her breakout, Fawcett got into movies and infinitely got busier. It took a toll on their marriage and ultimately broke it down.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/fawc-fotor-2023082116719-750x1024.jpg><p>At one point, Lee even claimed he only saw her for two weeks in a whole year. It did not take long for him to feel slighted by Fawcett’s independence.&nbsp;They went their separate ways in 1982 but remained mutual friends until Fawcett fell in love with his friend Ryan O’Neal.&nbsp;</p><p>They barely <a href=#>communicated</a> in the years that followed. Then Lee heard about her fight with cancer and called her on her 62nd birthday to wish her well.&nbsp;</p><p>An insider said: “They had a 40-minute conversation about her life and the cancer. They joked, and they got a little bit emotional.”</p><p>There was reportedly even talk about them working together. However, it was not to be because Fawcett passed on four months later.&nbsp;</p><p>Lee has moved on, but he has never forgotten Fawcett, nor will he since his current wife looks a lot like her. Other stars like Lee, who fell for women decades younger than them, include <a href=#>George Clooney</a>, Eddie Murphy, and Mel Gibson.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51kuqax02ajnp1doq6ru9GsZKyon6rApnnSoZxmq5iWv6a%2FjJqlZq2emK6vuthmqZ6rlaKvra3NnJxmr5mptW60yKxkpZmkmnqmxI4%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./phish-end-annual-nye-run-with-iconic-gamehendge-peformance-at-msg.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Phish End Annual NYE Run With Iconic Gamehendge Performance At MSG">&larr;
