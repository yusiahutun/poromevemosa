Sure, about the only thing we have in common is <a href=#>a desire to set food on fire</a>, you know, artfully. He does so these days to great acclaim on <a href=#>his private Patagonian island</a> (and 8 other restaurants around the world), accessible through two flights, a five-hour drive, and then 90-minute raft across a lake. I live on a busy block of a crowded city accessible by nearly every format of public transportation, and do so to moderate acclaim (relative mostly to how well the <a href=#>patrons</a> slept that day) under a wispy-by-design gas broiler.<p><a class=more-link href=#>Read more <span>»</span></a></p><a class=smittenkitchen-thumbnail href=# rel=bookmark><img width=4429 height=2952 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/149401384.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads//2018/02/chocolate-peanut-butter-cup-cookies.jpg alt decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class=smittenkitchen-primary-category>Recipe</span></a> The internet, or at least as far as I’ve seen, has three favorite peanut butter cookies. The first is a thing where you take a peanut butter cookie dough or prepared chocolate chip cookie dough, press it into a mini-muffin tin, press a miniature peanut butter cup inside of it and <a href=#>bake them together</a>. Nobody has ever made these for me and I’m kind of mad about it. The second is this 4-ingredient, one bowl, hand-whisked salted peanut butter cookie, curiously absent in flour, butter and leaveners, that’s been around forever until the clever cooks at <a href=#>Ovenly</a> figured out that using brown sugar instead of white, them into larger half-domes, and covering them with sea salt <a href=#>raised them to the unforgettable</a>. The third is a soft chocolate cookie wrapped around a peanut butter filling and bakes into peanut butter cup cookies. No wait, pillows.<p><a class=more-link href=#>Read more <span>»</span></a></p><a class=smittenkitchen-thumbnail href=# rel=bookmark><img width=4593 height=3063 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/149401384.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads//2018/01/scaccia-ragusana-stromboli.jpg alt decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class=smittenkitchen-primary-category>Recipe</span></a> This is not a stromboli. If we’ve spoken in the last day, I’ve demanded that <a href=#>you</a> weigh on a name for this dish. Pizza Strudel? Thousand-Layer Stromboli? Stromboli Babka? But that’s not where it began. It began as a dish called <a href=#>Scaccia Ragusana</a>, which I found in an old <a href=#>Saveur</a> issue. This stuffed flatbread is a Sicilian specialty from the province of Ragusa, made with a very thin rectangular layer of dough that’s folded in on itself a few times to make a veritable mille-feuille of a pie, with a dozen stunning layers greeting you when you, lucky you, cut into it. Not all scaccias have these thin folded layers; usually only the tomato and cheese ones do, while others have fillings from ricotta and fried eggplant, ricotta and sausage, greens, beans and more, folded over and crimped at the edges, sometimes elaborately with a braid, like a giant empanada.<p><a class=more-link href=#>Read more <span>»</span></a></p><a class=smittenkitchen-thumbnail href=# rel=bookmark><img width=4833 height=3222 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/149401384.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads//2018/01/banana-oat-weekday-pancakes.jpg alt decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class=smittenkitchen-primary-category>Recipe</span></a> My favorite buttermilk pancakes are <a href=#>tall, fluffy, buttery show-offs</a>. I make them on the weekend because my mom always made pancakes on the weekend and it feels as weekend-y as cake for breakfast should. But does Thursday morning deserve a pancake, just for being Thursday? I realized recently that a weekday pancake is different to me — fork-mixed, one-bowl, and fairly nutrient-packed, something I could make the kids before school and feel like I was sending them out armed with essentials — and also that my existing recipes left me short. Even these <a href=#>very beloved oatmeal pancakes</a> require you to have or to make oatmeal before you begin, and then use two different flours and two different sugars. I love them… it’s just not happening on a weekday. [See also: complex thoughts or even a bare modicum of functioning before 9 am; alas, I live with two charges who disagree.]<p><a class=more-link href=#>Read more <span>»</span></a></p><a class=smittenkitchen-thumbnail href=# rel=bookmark><img width=5616 height=3744 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/149401384.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads//2018/01/sheet-pan-meatballs-with-crispy-turmeric-chickpeas.jpg alt decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class=smittenkitchen-primary-category>Recipe</span></a> In October of last year, I made one of the best, and prettiest, dinners I’d had all year and couldn’t wait to tell you about them. Then I got a *little* (<a href=#>29 flights and 24 cities in 7 weeks</a>) busy and somehow (somehow!) they — along with the <a href=#>Dutch apple pie</a>, <a href=#>this endive salad</a> and some brown butter carrots I’m still holding out on you — fell by the wayside. And so let me present a long-overdue entry in the <a href=#>Best of</a> <a href=#>2017 files</a>, eagerly hoping to make a run in 2018.<p><a class=more-link href=#>Read more <span>»</span></a></p><a class=smittenkitchen-thumbnail href=# rel=bookmark><img width=2569 height=1712 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/149401384.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads//2018/01/img_0753.jpg alt decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class=smittenkitchen-primary-category>Recipe</span></a> According to my calendar, on December 19th I ostensibly signed <a href=#>special ordered books</a> at The Strand and then took my <a href=#>two year-old</a> to a holiday party, but I know the truth, which is that I was actually reading <a href=#>this hilarious piece</a> on Bon Appetit from Alex Delany in which he complains that winter cocktails are usually too unsubtly wintery, that he doesn’t need “seven sticks of cinnamon, half a holly tree or a metric ton of cloves, mulling spices or liquor that tastes like cookies” to entice him to drink booze in the winter, and texting my husband that we should make boulevardiers that night after the kids went to sleep.<p><a class=more-link href=#>Read more <span>»</span></a></p><a class=smittenkitchen-thumbnail href=# rel=bookmark><img width=4620 height=3080 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/149401384.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads//2018/01/split-pea-soup.jpg alt decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class=smittenkitchen-primary-category>Recipe</span></a> Here are a few things I know to be true: Split pea soup is never going to win the winter soup Olympics. Its signature hue of mushy pea green will never be prized as fashionable by anyone but the unfashionable likes of me. If you know people who stand up and cheer when they hear that it’s a split pea soup for dinner kind of evening, you know amazing, rare unicorn people I would like to have over for dinner more often. It could be argued that split pea soup doesn’t help its cause by its, ahem, mushy texture that usually solidifies into a brick in a fridge overnight, which is why it surprised me as much as it did that when I mentioned making it — along with <a href=#>this black bread</a> — in <a href=#>this food diary</a> I kept for Grub Street last week, so many people asked me for the recipe.<p><a class=more-link href=#>Read more <span>»</span></a></p><a class=smittenkitchen-thumbnail href=# rel=bookmark><img width=4449 height=2966 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/149401384.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads//2017/12/salted-butter-chocolate-chunk-shortbread.jpg alt decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class=smittenkitchen-primary-category>Recipe</span></a> Can there be a cookie of the year? Sure, it’s possible that I spend too much time consuming food media, the takes, the Tweets, the Instagram Stories. But if I didn’t, I wouldn’t have seen Alison Roman’s Salted Butter and Chocolate Chunk Shortbread Cookies virtually everywhere, weakening my resistance to the point that I had to try them, and when I did, realizing that just in case you’d missed them on, like, Refinery 29 or Eater or in <a href=#>her incredible first cookbook</a>, I had to tell you about them because they should not be missed.<p><a class=more-link href=#>Read more <span>»</span></a></p><a class=smittenkitchen-thumbnail href=# rel=bookmark><img width=4840 height=3227 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/149401384.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads//2017/12/dutch-apple-pie.jpg alt decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class=smittenkitchen-primary-category>Recipe</span></a> Before I abandoned you (online) to spend time with you (<a href=#>in person</a>) the better part of the last two months, leading to premature but rightly deserved <a href=#>obituaries</a>*, I spend about half of the fall I was in town for obsessed with Dutch apple pie, and a significant amount of that time trying to understand what it was and was not. There seems to be a divide wherein American home cooking sites largely refer to a Dutch apple pie as a deep-dish apple pie (sometimes, but not always, in a cake pan) with a crumb topping and Dutch (or Dutch-sounding; I do not speak the language** so am making an educated guess) cooks use a more cookie-like dough that’s cross-crossed on top with a shiny finish. Fortunately, around this time I remembered that one of my son’s good friend’s mom is Dutch and she was happy to set me on the right course: yes the lattice is shiny, the dough is sweet and more buttery tasting than its American counterpart, the end result looks more like a cake, and please remember to send all samples over.<p><a class=more-link href=#>Read more <span>»</span></a></p><a class=smittenkitchen-thumbnail href=# rel=bookmark><img width=4963 height=3308 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/149401384.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads//2017/12/endive-salad-with-breadcrumbs-and-walnuts1.jpg alt decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class=smittenkitchen-primary-category>Recipe</span></a> I understand that most people, normal people, can outline phases of their lives through jobs or photo albums or even where they lived; I apparently can do it through endive salads I was obsessed with at the time. In 2005, there was one from Nigella Lawson <a href=#>in the New York Times</a> with <a href=#>toasted hazelnuts, grain mustard, lime and orange and sesame oil</a>. My husband and I were a relatively new thing at the time and he wasn’t terribly into endive but he ate it politely for weeks and weeks, and eventually came around, or caved. Same thing, right?<p><a class=more-link href=#>Read more <span>»</span></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirnZ7BtbHNpKCtm5iau2%2BvzqZmqZmXmnxzfo54p2po</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./beaver-productions-don-fox-to-retire.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Beaver Productions Don Fox To Retire">&larr;
