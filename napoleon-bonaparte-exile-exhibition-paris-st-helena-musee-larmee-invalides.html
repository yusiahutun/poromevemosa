They include a pair of crimson leather slippers, touchingly scuffed and creased, the cream lining slightly stained.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>When Napoleon’s valet first put them on his master’s small feet, he would never have imagined that they would be worn in exile.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>“It was not a foregone conclusion that Napoleon would abdicate, or that he would die in exile,” says Dancoisne-Martineau. “For his first three years on the island, he was expecting to return. For his last two years, he abandoned all hope that that would happen. He no longer received people; he no longer went out.”</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>Napoleon lost the <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">Battle of Waterloo</a> on 18 June 1815 and fled to Paris, where he hoped to rebuild political and popular support as emperor. Instead, he abdicated four days later in favour of his three-year-old son. After the provisional government formally deposed him, too, his father sailed from France for the last time and surrendered to the British on 10 July. After his escape from Elba a year earlier, the English were taking no chances: he was never permitted to set foot on British soil again.</p><figure id=39ecd446-86ac-4bfa-8606-524a893d99e5 data-spacefinder-role=showcase data-spacefinder-type=model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement class=dcr-5h0uf4><span class=dcr-1inf02i></span><span class=dcr-1qvd3m6>The French Squadron at Saint Helena by Jean-Baptiste Henri Durand-Brager.</span> Photograph: Giovanni Dagli Orti / RMN-GP/Musée de l'Armée</figure><p class=dcr-epamsi>The first object in the exhibition at Les Invalides is a painting on loan from the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich, south London, showing Plymouth harbour with an armada of small boats full of tourists being rowed out to gaze in wonder at the diminutive figure of Boney, taking exercise by pacing the deck of HMS Bellerophon.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>The public fascination must have unnerved the authorities, who decided to send him to the most remote spot they could find, the tiny island of St Helena in the south Atlantic, more than 7,000km (4,300 miles) from <a href=# data-link-name="in body link" data-component=auto-linked-tag>Paris</a> and London.</p><figure id=da359cb3-b1d5-48f2-abc3-18f12f72c532 data-spacefinder-role=richLink data-spacefinder-type=model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement class=dcr-1your1i><a href=# class=dcr-1m887w9>St Helena gets ready for tourism take-offRead more</a></figure><p class=dcr-epamsi>By coincidence, this exhibition – planned to coincide with the completion of much-needed conservation work in Europe on some of the furniture from the house – opens just as St Helena’s isolation, almost as great as in Napoleon’s day, is about to end with <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">the opening of a new airport</a> that is expected to bring a tourism bonanza.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>Napoleon died on his rock in 1821.

Some of his discoveries are in the exhibition. One speaks vividly of how the island got on with life after its strange encounter with one of the giants of history: the small, square altar stone, on which the the last mass by the bed of the dying emperor would have been celebrated, was found in an island farmhouse. It had been used as a smooth surface for grinding down rat poison.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi><span data-dcr-style=bullet></span> <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">Napoleon in Saint Helena: The Conquest of Memory</a>, is at Musée de l’Armée, Les Invalides, Paris, until 24 July.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>Maev Kennedy visited the exhibition as a guest of <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">St Helena Tourism</a> and Eurostar</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoKyaqpSerq96wqikaJmiqa6vsMOeqqKfnmR%2FcX2VaJipql9nfXC6wKmmpZ2fo3qju82ap5qqpJp6psTIpZxmnaidtqO106Kmp2Wglr%2Bqv4ysq2aglaGyr62MpqysnZViuaK%2BzJ6cZqGeq66ttcOeqg%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./article-6ce745cf-f5d6-5e38-9e21-60ab456a734b-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Taylor Swift's love songs for Travis Kelce | Lifestyles">&larr;
