He rose to prominence as a result of his appearances on MTV’s “Teen Mom 2.” He was recently arrested for</p><h3>Early Life</h3><p>David Eason was born in North Carolina, United States on 23rd June 1988. When it comes to his siblings, he has one sister, Jessica Eason Miller. Eason received good grades throughout his high school education. Following that, David completed a Bachelor’s degree at a state institution in the United States.</p><h3>David Eason Career</h3><p>Before pursuing a career in reality television, David Eason worked as a pipe welder. He got more public attention after he started dating Janella Evans. He’s also become a social media sensation, with over half a million followers on Instagram. He continues to post photos of his family on Instagram. On the popular show Teen Mom 2, he co-stars with his wife. Eason and Evans have been producing a YouTube video called I Have Something To Say in which they discuss Nugget’s death and the CPS inquiry. Nugget, according to Eason, was gentle with him but not with the kids. David, according to reports, is currently unemployed and does not have a stable job.</p><p>In February of this year, he posted a homophobic message on Twitter. He was widely criticized by the general population. MTV dismissed him from the Teen Mom 2 reality show due to the widespread criticism he received. MTV issued a statement claiming that Eason’s personal remarks do not reflect MTV’s values and that his contract with the network has been immediately terminated. David has also provided links to his metal and woodworking firm, Black River, in reaction to people ridiculing him for not having a job. Although David Eason’s tenure on reality TV was brief, he has a long history of generating controversy.</p><h4>Controversy</h4><p>When it was revealed that David had killed their family dog, reports of him being violent at home became more widespread. Janelle was dismissed from Teen Mom and both she and David were given temporary custody of their children as a result of this heinous crime. Janelle and David split in October of this year. In February 2020, though, the pair reconciled. David was charged with assault in June and was arrested.</p><p>On Friday, Jenelle Evans’ husband, David Eason, was arrested in North Carolina for ‘driving while intoxicated’ and ‘possession of an open container.’ On Nov. 12, the 33-year-old reality star was arrested on various charges and placed into a Columbus County jail about 10:30 p.m., before being released at 2:40 a.m. Eason, who was on Teen Mom 2 for years before being dismissed for homophobic tweets, was also charged with Driving While License Is Revoked and has a court appearance set for Feb. 16.</p><table><tbody><tr><th colspan=2><h3>David Eason Biography</h3></th></tr><tr><td width=40%>Real Name</td><td width=60%>David Martin Eason</td></tr><tr><td>Birth Date</td><td><span class=hidden-sm>June</span>&nbsp;23,&nbsp;1988</td></tr><tr><td>Age (as of 2021)</td><td>33 Years</td></tr><tr><td>Birth Place</td><td>United States</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Reality Star</td></tr><tr><td>Religion</td><td>Christianity</td></tr><tr><td>Sun sign</td><td>Cancer</td></tr><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Physical Statistics</h3></th></tr><tr><td colspan=2><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthyspy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/David-Eason-2.jpg alt width=960 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>in feet inches&nbsp;<strong>– 6’ 2” – </strong>in Centimeters <strong>– 187 cm</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>in Kilograms&nbsp;<strong>– 88 kg&nbsp; –&nbsp; </strong>in Pounds&nbsp;<strong>–&nbsp; 194 lbs</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Shoe Size</td><td>14 (U.S.)</td></tr><tr><td>Hair Color</td><td>Brown</td></tr><tr><td>Eye Color</td><td>Blue</td></tr><tr><td>Body Type</td><td>Athletic</td></tr><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Family</h3></th></tr><tr><td>Father</td><td>–</td></tr><tr><td>Mother</td><td>–</td></tr><tr><td>Sister</td><td>–</td></tr><tr><td>Brother</td><td>–</td></tr><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Qualification/Education</h3></th></tr><tr><td>School</td><td>Local High School</td></tr><tr><td>College</td><td>–</td></tr><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Relationship Status</h3></th></tr><tr><td colspan=2><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthyspy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/David-Eason-3.jpg alt width=960 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></td></tr><tr><td>Marital Status</td><td>Married</td></tr><tr><td>Who is his wife?</td><td>Jenelle Evans</td></tr><tr><td>Children</td><td>Two (Ensley Jolie Eason, Maryssa Eason)</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Personal Life</h3><p>Whitney Johnson had been David’s former wife.
