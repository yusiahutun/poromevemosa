The song, which also features Joe Walsh, is currently in the Top 40 on the country singles chart and continues to be one of the most added songs at country radio week after week.<span id=more-81094></span></p><p>"I got the idea [for the song] when I was driving home or on my way back home," Green tells Taste of Country. "I simply saw a U-Haul on the side of the road by a cafe. It was just down the street, and I saw this younger guy get out and I was thinking, 'I wonder what it's like to be new to this town right now...' I was thinking 'New to This Town,' but I didn't think too much of it. I just kind of filed it away. Then I started taking that concept and working on a lot of the first verse."</p><p>"I was sitting at the cafe for a bite / And couldn’t help but overhear this guy / He just pulled up in a U-Haul truck / Tell Becky how pumped he was / ‘Bout movin’ here for his new job / And what a cool little spot it was / Kinda made me jealous, made me mad / Wish I could see this place like that," he outlined in the lyrics to the opening verse of the potential song.</p><p>"I was set up to write with Kix and we all had written a couple of songs," Green continues. "I knew he had already recorded a lot of his record. I brought it up there and said I had this idea. I told them how it kind of started and sang a good portion of the first verse."</p><p>"The title pretty much says it all," Kix Brooks adds. "I wanted to put it down while it was fresh in my mind. It was as if it were meant to be."</p><p>"Wish I was new to this town / Just pullin’ in / Checkin’ it out for the first time / Wish I could go anywhere / And not be afraid of finding you there / Girl when I see you around / I wish I was new to this town," they wrote in the chorus of the song.</p><p>"I have to credit Kix a lot on the chorus," notes Green. "He kind of got a lot of the chorus melody and those ideas going, Terry, too. We kind of built it from there. We did a worktape of that song. I really felt like this was the [song] that everybody was going to gravitate toward."</p><p>"Then it was mentioned, ‘some Joe Walsh sounding slide’ would sound great on the track," Brooks explains. "What are the chances the man himself would be generous enough to help me out! What you hear today is a lotta luck ... and a little bit of magic. You can't go back, but finding a place to start over is what makes life worth living. I'm really excited!"</p><a class="next-post cto" href=#>Listen to Kix Brooks, 'New to This Town'</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmpKGoYq%2Bzu86kqmamlax6tbuMrZ%2Biq12pvLi6jKWwq6GTqHw%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./rock-on-the-range-sro.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Rock On The Range SRO">&larr;
