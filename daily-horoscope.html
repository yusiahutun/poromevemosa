Meanwhile people celebrating Australia Day are in the height of summer! Yet as innovative Uranus changes direction this weekend, wherever we are, and whatever the weather, we're being called to march to the beat of our own drum. By considering different approaches we can get closer to realising our goals. And with Venus' encouragement, even if we don't achieve medal-winning results, we'll enjoy the process and make satisfying progress.</p><p id=e1RYJ3hztnh data-wc=43>Are you ready for your future? Discover your Destiny. These spookily accurate birth charts, based on your unique birth placements will tell you everything you need to know. Simply enter your birth details and receive a completely personal <a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopener nofollow">2024 'Guide to the Future'</a></p><h2>ARIES</h2><p id=e0EzWSa6ysP data-wc=93>When we find people intimidating, we tend to defer to their demands; we're polite and courteous. When we find ourselves in the company of people who inspire us, we have a much richer sense of awe and respect. You're trying to work out how to deal with someone in your world who is reluctant to learn a valuable lesson. The easiest option would be to firmly express your feelings. But if, this weekend, you reach out with understanding, and make a heartfelt connection, you'll find a way to gain the cooperation you need.</p><h2>TAURUS</h2><p id=e0dw4lZMpFa data-wc=83>You deserve to walk tall and hold your head high this weekend. You've been dealing with several tricky situations, which have involved learning some important (not to mention challenging) lessons. But you've done well. With Uranus, the innovator, turning direct in your sign, you're inevitably edging towards a more productive and rewarding phase of your future. To make the most of the encouraging celestial outlook, you need to act with confidence. That means shaking off any self-doubt, and looking ahead, with more optimism.</p><h2>GEMINI</h2><p id=e11qLxnZmIz data-wc=94>We might not have access to machines that beam us forwards or backwards through time, but we're all still time-travellers en route from the past to the future. And although we can't change the speed of our physical journey, our minds can nip around all over the place. Our thoughts often spend more time focused on yesterday (or tomorrow) than they do on the present. And with our imaginations we're able to visit alternate realities too. This weekend, an innovative idea can be the start of a real-life adventure. Change is in the air.</p><h2>CANCER</h2><p id=e0aT8YZ5uj4 data-wc=95>A Bob Dylan lyric for you: 'There must be some way out of here, said the joker to the thief. There's too much confusion, I can't get no relief'. People have been trying to work out this song's meaning for years. I mention it, because you've got so used to dealing with a confusing situation you've grown immune to its complexities. You've normalised them. The good news, is that as Uranus starts moving forwards this weekend, you're about to find your way out of the messiness and into clarity. It's enough to make you sing!</p><h2>LEO</h2><p id=e0lAzmVxCVZ data-wc=101>The Wizard of Oz is a film full of useful messages. We start with Dorothy in a strange land, far from home. The wizard promises to help her return, but accidentally leaves without her. What is she going to do? After various adventures and challenges, she realises that she's always had the tools needed to get her back to where she wants to be. All she has to do is click her ruby slippers and make a wish. This weekend brings the insight to realise that you don't need to wait for anyone to grant you power. You've already got it.</p><h2>VIRGO</h2><p id=e17CxcGAldX data-wc=93>Suppose you open the front door, and the wind blows leaves into your hallway. You need to sweep them up. But your broom's bristles have worn down. If you angle it in the right way, you can just about manage. But how much easier would it be if you had a new one? Could you be wasting your energy, and investing unnecessary effort, because you're abiding by an old, unsatisfactory arrangement? As Uranus moves direct this weekend it offers an alternative way of looking at a problematic situation. You can easily resolve it.</p><h2>LIBRA</h2><p id=e1NroZUC53Y data-wc=96>It's all very well to say that nature abhors a vacuum, but what does that mean? Although planet Earth has lots of spaces that appear empty, none of them have 'nothing' in them. And so it is with humans. It seems that the natural world can't bear voids, so it immediately fills them. Following your ruler's link to Uranus, if you're experiencing an emotional 'lack' in your life, you can expect the arrival of something (or someone) to fill it. And, if you'd like something new to enter your world this weekend, start making some space.</p><h2>SCORPIO</h2><p id=e0N3aurFsFK data-wc=104>When we've been dealing with a difficult situation for a long time, it's only when we're getting to the end of it that we realise how much it has taken out of us. It's at that point too, that we can see why the experience was necessary, and start appreciating what it taught us. But when we're in the midst of it, that reflection can't occur. As Uranus turns direct this weekend, you'll start to see the good in much that has seemed less than ideal. And as you move onwards, with a sense of confidence, the future really will start to look bright.</p><h2>SAGITTARIUS</h2><p id=e0mIJHOVbfm data-wc=96>When we're stressed and the pressure is on, it's easy to forget that the people around us aren't mind readers. We expect them to know that we're struggling and need help. And, if we don't get it, we can even start to doubt the strength of that relationship. Or resent the fact that they're not meeting our needs. This weekend, taking the time to explain how you're feeling will make a big difference to someone's attitude and their willingness to cooperate with you. Not only will you find the assistance you need. Your connection will improve.</p><h2>CAPRICORN</h2><p id=e1BcvQboNZS data-wc=90>Have you noticed the attention you're getting? Or the positive affirmations coming your way? Venus (love and abundance) is in Capricorn, which implies that even if your appearance hasn't changed, you're glowing with magnetic charm; and it's enabling people to see more to you than they've seen before. It's not the equivalent of having a magic wand to wave - you still need to articulate your needs and desires. But this cosmic gift deserves to be appreciated. It's valuable. If you need help this weekend, you only have to ask.</p><h2>AQUARIUS</h2><p id=e1dRJTfWVcr data-wc=94>Why are we advised to seek out someone busy if we need help? It's hardly logical advice... is it? If someone's already got a lot to do, surely there's a chance they won't have time to do what you need them to do? Yet busy people tend to be hardworking, efficient and conscientious. They don't mind adding another task to their list. They enjoy being helpful. With your ruler, Uranus turning direct, and boosting your skillset, what feels like a burden to someone you care about is something you can easily sort this weekend.</p><h2>PISCES</h2><p id=e1xFgITUiW7 data-wc=95>Is it true that carrots help us see in the dark? Apparently, there's some truth to this maxim. In case you're interested, orange food, which is high in Vit A, help us maintain our vision. But I mention this old saying because when we believe in an idea, it gives us confidence. Whether there's scientific evidence to back it up (or not) if we think something works, our positivity can lead to impressive results. Don't dismiss someone's beliefs just because they seem illogical this weekend. You might find they lead to a surprisingly pleasing outcome.</p><h3 class="blockTitleHeading_bfgeavs hm-heading">ZODIAC SIGNS</h3><ul class=HoroscopesList_h1pii8u5 aria-label=Horoscopes><li class=HoroscopesListItem_h1rkhu1s><a aria-label=Aries class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/6482a8793588-aries.jpg><h4 class="HoroscopesItemTitle_hc9ai1d hm-heading">Daily Aries Horoscope</h4><span class=HoroscopesItemSubtitle_h1atkt5>21 March -
