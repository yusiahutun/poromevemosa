But have you ever considered that this apparent lack of options might have something to do with the colour of your clothes? Perhaps the reason you can't find anything to wear might be because the shades of your garments don’t accurately represent how you're feeling.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“Colour is one of these amazing forms of self-expression,” says colour psychologist Karen Haller. “What colour allows us to do is communicate how we’re feeling, how we want to feel or how we want other people to interact with us – without actually saying anything at all.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Here, we guide you through the impact that different colours can have, how to work out which shades suit you best, and the easiest ways to incorporate them into your wardrobe.</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><h2 data-node-id=5 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">What colour means to us</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">As humans, only 20 per cent of the decisions we make are conscious – the rest happen without us even realising. This same rule applies when we wear colour: we have emotional experiences with different hues and shades, and respond to them subconsciously.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“Colour was our primary method of decision-making, before we could talk,” says Haller, who worked with high-street retailer Reiss on its recent collection colour scheme. “It still is our primary language on a subconscious level. By making colour conscious again, we can tap into emphasising our emotions." In other words: we make judgements on instinct when we see certain colours, which produces specific emotions.</p><img alt=colour title=colour width=3744 height=5616 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/tiffany-hsu-wears-a-neon-pink-shirt-a-neon-pink-oversized-news-photo-1677502593.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Edward Berthelot</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/play.db7c035.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=24 width=24 alt="Play Icon" role=img title=Play style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><img alt="preview for The best of couture spring/summer 2023" title="Video player poster image" width=2000 height=1000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/models-present-creations-for-fendi-couture-during-the-haute-news-photo-1674814739.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Colour associations are everywhere: we wear black to funerals and white on wedding days, pastels in the summer and darker tones in winter. While some associations have grown from tradition, there's an interesting evolutionary background to many of our choices. “Green gives us a level of reassurance and rejuvenation, as at one point in our history, it would have meant survival,” Haller explains. “Whereas brown feels supporting and very grounding, like a tree.”</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>“As humans, only 20 per cent of the decisions we make are conscious”<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Dressing for your mood isn’t exactly a new phenomenon – the term <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/fashion/a36286827/dopamine-dressing/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="dopamine dressing" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">dopamine dressing</a> has circulated for years – but Haller says that, often, it's more about personal connection to a shade, rather than colour having the same effect on us all. Many of our memories centre around clothing, whether it’s what you or someone else wore at the time. We hold on to these memories and what triggers them; it's this backlog of information that makes up our emotional map of various colours.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“We have our own perceptions for different colours and what they mean to us, whether that’s positive or negative,” says Haller. “It depends on you as a person and your behaviour towards the colour.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">She continues: “Say I’m wearing red and I feel really angry and agitated. In a way, red reinforces that behaviour. Someone else might feel energised by wearing the exact same shade. Black can make someone feel confident, or blue calmer, while orange is all about being energised for some. The colour either supports how you’re feeling, how you want to feel, or how others perceive you.”<br></p><h2 data-node-id=15 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">How to wear more colour</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">When we know how colours can represent, or even influence, different moods, we can dress better to reflect our own, while making the most of what suits us and our wardrobes.</p><img alt=colour title=colour width=1024 height=683 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/emili-sindlev-wearing-yellow-knit-cardigan-green-wide-leg-news-photo-1677502782.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Christian Vierig</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">So, how do you start incorporating more colour into your own wardrobe if you don’t wear much already? Stylist and avid colour wearer Zeena Shah recommends starting small, so that it doesn’t feel too overwhelming.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“It might be wearing some brightly coloured socks that only you know about, which bring you joy,” she advises. “Accessories are also a great way to bring some colour to an outfit. A necklace, handbag or scarf that can be tied onto a bag or around your neck is an inexpensive way to inject some colour. The more you start to wear colour, the more you’ll notice how it makes you feel and the more you’ll want to wear it.”</p><img alt="zeena shah" title="Zeena Shah " width=3024 height=4032 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/atheartzeena-29-1677502044.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Courtesy of Zeena Shah</span><p>Zeena Shah</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>"Colour either supports how you’re feeling, how you want to feel, or how others perceive you"<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Choosing to delve into the world of colour also means figuring out what suits you and flatters your skin tone. “I like to start with one colour that I know makes me feel great, and then try different shades,” says Shah. “Try comparing a pale pastel green with a vivid bright green. Notice which brings light to your face and boosts your mood.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">She also recommends turning to social media for guidance. “There’s so much inspiration on Instagram and TikTok. Bookmark creators with similar skin tones to you, to help inspire some colour combinations to try next,” she explains. “The more you embrace colour, the more you’ll find your colour confidence.”</p><img alt="zeena shah" title="Zeena Shah " width=3024 height=4032 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/atheartzeena-04-1677502258.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Courtesy of Zeena Shah</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Rental is also a great place to start experimenting with wearing more colour. There are plenty of apps and rental sites – <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/fashion/what-to-wear/g30545044/best-fashion-rental-sites/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="By Rotation, Hurr and Cocoon are among our favourites to use" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">By Rotation, Hurr and Cocoon are among our favourites to use</a> – that provide a non-committal way to dial up your looks and discover what suits you, in a more eco-conscious manner. “Renting your pieces, rather than buying them, is a much more mindful way of shopping and less colour commitment too,” notes Shah. “Then, once you've tried them and feel more comfortable, you can invest in the colours that really make you feel good.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">If something feels worth the investment, apply the same rules as your wardrobe neutrals, by choosing timeless styles that work for your body. “Think about the shape and cut of what you're going to buy and whether that suits you, as well as opting for pieces that won't date and can be layered with pieces existing in your wardrobe already,” she advises, suggesting an emerald green slip dress, a pink handbag and an orange cashmere jumper to get started. “You can't go wrong with block colour and good-quality materials; don't forget it's important to shop for what will wear well, in addition to giving you that dopamine hit.”<br></p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>"Renting your pieces means less colour commitment"<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">How do you not get swayed by passing trends? “I try my best to avoid them and instead take a more thoughtful approach,” she says. “For me, it’s always about taking a step back to think about my wardrobe and not rushing to purchase something new, just because it’s what everyone is wearing. It’s a slow change in mindset, but making a style wishlist or mood board and giving myself 24 hours before I hit buy has really helped.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Identifying which colours have good personal associations for you (and suit you) can completely change your approach to getting dressed. “What we wear is an expression of identity and personality,” Zeena says. “As I've gotten older, I care a lot less about what people think; getting dressed is for me and not to please anyone else. Wearing something that makes you feel good is a no-brainer in my book. We spend most of our lives in clothing so it should bring all the joy.”<br></p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfqrhwssCsn6KnnmTEqa3TZquoZaearrN7wG1qaXFjaIB3e8Koo6itomK9tMXCoaalp5eufA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./what-does-it-mean-to-dream-about-football-training.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What does it mean to dream about Football training">&larr;
