I made a few not-great movies, usually the ones I produced – like Bolero and Tarzan, The Ape Man – that weren’t good for my career or my bank account. It seemed everyone wanted to ‘exploit’ Bo Derek.

During the National Horse Show in Seville, Spain, I jumped on a chariot with the great horseman, Mario Lurashci. He took off at full speed, the dirt was hitting me in the face and we slid around the final turn at an impossibly fast gallop. As we came to a stop in front of the royal box, the crowd was screaming and cheering.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Frankly I was grateful to be alive, my legs were rubber. Then, as I stepped off, I looked down and saw that the reins were wrapped around the toe of my boot. There was nothing I could do but fall flat on my face. I’ll never forget the sound of 700 Spaniards gasping in horror. I ungracefully got up and took a very grand bow.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Also, I fall over on red carpets all the time. Once I even got out of a car onto a red carpet, fell, grabbed a pole and did a spin-down, like a pole dancer.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span><span class="mol-style-medium mol-style-bold event-ccox">Which living person do you despise the most and why?</span></span></p><img id=i-2b6562510997c49b src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/07/23/14/2AC6ABEC00000578-3171964-image-a-98_1437656583092.jpg height=302 width=306 alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>There are so many people I could name but I won’t because I don’t want to be killed walking out of here.

Your body changes no matter what you do, but I took up open-water swimming and that’s made a huge difference. I had back surgery three years ago and the surgeon said the best physical therapy is swimming. That year a friend and I swam the iconic Hellespont in Turkey, a six-kilometre swim from Europe to Asia. Now we have made a promise to each other to choose a beautiful place to swim once a year. This year we will swim in the Spetses Marathon in Greece.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span><span class="mol-style-medium mol-style-bold event-ccox">What is the worst job you’ve done?</span></span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>When I was 15 I fried fish and French fries at a seafood stand on a pier in Long Beach, California.
