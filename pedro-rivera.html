He emigrated to the United States in 1966, hoping to better his life and that of his family.</p><p>Pedro Rivera is a multi-talented actor, composer, producer, interpreter, and artist-producer. His talent and self-assurance helped him become a household name in a country where he had immigrated in the hopes of doing the same. Pedro has produced almost 1590 recorded songs and 50 productions, which is a remarkable accomplishment.</p><p>Pedro has even performed as a vocalist and judge in several musical performances in the United States and Mexico.</p><h2><span id=What_is_the_Net_Worth_of_Pedro_Rivera_Salary_Earnings>What is the Net Worth of Pedro Rivera? Salary, Earnings</span></h2><p>Pedro Rivera’s net worth is estimated to be<strong> $4 million</strong> in 2021. However, his children’s net wealth is more than his own. Pete Rivera has a net worth of $12.5 million, while his other children, Gustavo and Jenni Rivera, have a net worth of<strong> $25 million</strong>. Lupillo Rivera, his other child, has a net worth of $12.5 million, while Juan Rivera has a net worth of $10 million. Finally, his daughter, Rosie Rivera Flores, has a net worth of $5 million.</p><h2><span id=Pedro_Rivera-_Married_Life>Pedro Rivera-&nbsp; Married Life</span></h2><p>Pedro Rivera was married to Doa Rosa Saavedra, and their relationship produced five children. Don Pedro, however, has had an extramarital romance with Erika Alonso. This was the primary reason for Pedro and Dona’s breakup. Pedro married Juanita Ahumada for the second time in 2019.</p><h2><span id=Pedro_Rivera-_Professional_Career>Pedro Rivera- Professional Career</span></h2><ul><li>He and his wife and children collected the iconic Olympic buttons in 1984 and raised enough monies to engage in his debut play, “Voy A Bajarte Una Estrella.” This label has released over 50 projects and a minimum of 1590 recorded songs. It was a watershed moment in Pedro Rivera’s life.</li><li>In 1984, he made his debut as a still photographer for the film “Asalto in Tijuana.” Pedro debuted as an actor for the first time that same year. Pedro Rivera’s acting debut is in the film “Camino al Infierno.” “La Tumba del Mojado” was another significant film in which Pedro made an impression on the audience.</li><li>He was also instrumental in the popularity of the following songs: “El Especial,” “El Bato Perron,” “El Pato Nada,” “La Diva de la Banda,” and “Dando y Dando,” and “Jenni my Bendición,” among many others.</li><li>Pedro is regarded as a trailblazer for all who aspire. Pedro’s production company, “Cintas Acurio,” became the world’s largest Latin record label simply because of his hard work and dedication. Many of the aspiring musicians were developed in his record firm under this very record label. To mention a few, I like Los Razos, Rogelio Martinez, El Chapo de Sinaloa,</li><li>Valentin Elizalde, and many others. His accomplishments as a composer, actor, and producer are far too valuable.</li></ul><h2><span id=Body_Measurements_Height_Weight_Hair_color>Body Measurements: Height, Weight, Hair color</span></h2><p>Pedro Rivera stands<strong> 6 feet 1 inch tall</strong> and weighs 121 pounds <strong>(55</strong> <strong>kg)</strong>.
