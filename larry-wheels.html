On December 3, 1994, he was born in the Bronx, New York, United States. He had a difficult life when his father abandoned the family after his first birthday. He lived with his mother in the following years, who had to do multiple jobs to keep the family stable. Larry Wheels moved in with his grandparents when he was six years old after his mother was sexually assaulted by one of her boyfriends, but after a year, she kicked him out. He was then placed in a foster care facility, where he remained until he was 12 when his mother brought him back, and the two moved to the French Caribbean Island of Saint-Martin. Likewise, he belongs to American nationality, while his ethnicity is unknown.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.webofbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Larry-Wheels-Age.jpg><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=education><span id=Education><strong>Education</strong></span></h3><p>He dropped out very early because there were only two schools near the island, one dedicated to teaching French and the other two children with the privilege of being British. Larry is not fluent in French and cannot attend an English school. As a result, Larry was unable to complete his schooling.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=career><span id=Career><strong>Career</strong></span></h3><p>At age 18, Wheels competed in his first RPS weightlifting competition, where he competed in the 275-pound but 245-pound division, which he won. But it wasn’t until 2017 that Larry became famous when he hit a world record of 2,275 pounds (squat, bench, and deadlift).</p><p>In 2018, Wheels competed in his first bodybuilding competition, NPC Gold Coast Muscle Classic in California (Amateur Show), on February 3 and won the overall ranking.</p><p>In November 2018, Wheels competed at the NPC National Championships after accumulating 268 pounds of muscle since his amateur debut. Although he placed 11th, lower than he would have liked, it was still a learning experience, especially since this was only his second bodybuilding competition. Wheels has also been quite open about his steroid use, having talked about it several times. He even went into detail about steroid use before the 2020 Arnold Games.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=larry-wheels-personal-life><span id=Larry_Wheels_Personal_Life><strong>Larry Wheels Personal Life</strong></span></h3><p>Regarding Larry’s personal life, he is still unmarried. There is not any information on the Internet regarding Larry’s girlfriend. Because Larry has always kept the details of his love life private and hidden from the media, it’s unclear if Larry might have a girlfriend at this point. Larry does not talk about his relationship status on the Internet. It seems Larry is still single.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=body-measurements><span id=Body_Measurements><strong>Body Measurements</strong></span></h3><p>Larry is famous for his fitness, weight, stamina and size; He is 6’1” (1.86m) tall and weighs about 255 lbs.
