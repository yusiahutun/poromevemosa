That something is nothing compared to someone who actually knows <a href=# rel=noopener>how to customize a wig</a> with expert precision. Such was the case when I visited Doll Maker Studio in New York (pre-pandemic) to watch wig and weave stylist <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Anthony Jackson (aka @JaxxStylez)</a> transform two units I had very specific visions for. One would be a wavy, ever so slightly curly bob and the other would give me Old Hollywood glamour with body and bounce. In other words, I wanted one wig for everyday wear and another to whip out for special occasions. If you’re like me and rather leave the heavy lifting to a pro or want to brave the wig customization process at home, here’s what the most important steps look like on just one of my wigs.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/anua-cleansing-oil-tiktok.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Outlander.jpg><h2>Pick Your Wig</h2><p>For starters, don’t breeze through the research required for a wig you love. I envy anyone who is able to narrow down their choices and add to cart in a matter of minutes. Personally, I need to clear out a significant part of my day for this step. I’ve gotten lost in dozens of <a href=# rel=noopener>YouTube reviews</a> and even more <a href=# rel=noopener>wig websites</a> searching for a look that would hopefully make me do a double-take; the good kind of double-take, BTW. More often than not, I begin my search with at least a style in mind—say, a <a href=# rel=noopener>bob with bangs</a>, a platinum blonde lob, or something <a href=# rel=noopener>ultra-long</a> like Beyoncé in her LEMONADE era—but even that barely moves the needle. I’m still left with an innumerable amount of quality options to choose between.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/mayvenn-wigs.jpg><p>So far, the only factor to shorten my quest is sticking with <a href=# rel=noopener>wig brands</a> that have especially good word of mouth. In my circle of friends, that honor goes to Mayvenn. The Black-owned brand has been around for years, though until a few months ago, I had never taken the plunge and invested in any of their products because I procrastinate like it’s an Olympic sport. That changed in late February when I got the <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Brazilian Loose Wave 360 Wig</a> for my special occasion look and the <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Brazilian Deep Wave 360 Wig</a> for my wavy bob look. The affordable pricing combined with the add-on of free customization by a local stylist had me sold. Soon after, the fun part began.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/how-to-pluck-wig-hair.gif><h2>Part, Pluck and Repeat</h2><p>After shaking out my loose wave wig, Anthony placed it on a sturdy <a href=# rel=noopener>wig stand</a> and got to plucking. Though most people start the customization process by bleaching the knots (more on this in a sec), Anthony prefers working on the hairline first so he “can see the dark spots and fullness of the hair.” Nowadays, it’s possible to order <a href=# rel=noopener>a wig</a> that’s already been pre-plucked to make the hairline look realistic which in turn, leaves you with less work to do.</p><p>However, the beauty of a pro custom job is that you can sit with a stylist and describe exactly how you want it to look. In my case, Anthony plucked the hairline in such a way that it mimicked my natural one. He also took his time moving from the front to the middle-ish part of the unit, leaving about an inch in between each part. In other words, he would pluck, make a thin part, pluck, and so on and so forth. If you’re doing this at home, you’ll need a <a data-pmc-sp-product=ca29c0ba55457330736997d3630a2c66 href=# custom-ga-data='{"1pd":true,"category":"article-page","details":"rat tail comb","label":"buy-now","event_type_label":"Affiliate","url":true,"product":{"dimension1":"%=href=%","name":"2 Pieces Tail Combs Carbon Fiber Teasing Combs Rat Tail Lifting Combs Styling Combs for Hair Salon or Home Supplies (Pink)","price":"4.09","id":"B08923GFXS","category":"Hair Combs"},"id":1136474,"location":true}' custom-ga-track=click rel=nofollow>rat tail comb</a> and <a data-pmc-sp-product=23c0ef9ee53d463af945eb2dbd92b22c href=# custom-ga-data='{"1pd":true,"category":"article-page","details":"fine-point tweezers","label":"buy-now","event_type_label":"Affiliate","url":true,"product":{"dimension1":"%=href=%","name":"Tweezerman Stainless Steel Mini Slant Tweezer, Neon Pink, 1 Count","price":"10.41","id":"B000WI02HG","category":"Deodorants & Shave"},"id":1136474,"location":true}' custom-ga-track=click rel=nofollow>fine-point tweezers</a> . Generally speaking, straight-hair wigs require more plucking than curlier units too.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bleaching-wig-knots.gif><h2>Bleach the Knots</h2><p>Next came the part I was definitely happy to pass off. Once you’ve finished your first round of plucking to adjust the density of your wig hair and improve the hairline, bleaching the knots at the base of the lace cap helps to create the illusion of a natural scalp when you part your <a href=# rel=noopener>wig hair</a>. Otherwise, you’re left with an awkward-looking surface that, for lack of better words, doesn’t look cute.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/applying-bleach-to-wig.gif><p>With protective gloves on his hands, Anthony used <a href=#>Clairol Kaleidocolors</a> and <a href=#>developer</a> to lift the color. Specifically, he mixed one scoop of Kaleidocolors with two parts developer to achieve a thick and creamy consistency. Though it’s not pictured here, he also sprayed the wig beforehand with <a data-pmc-sp-product=15c4dd9b3da065ecd551fd12aafcd22a href=# custom-ga-data='{"1pd":true,"category":"article-page","details":"Sparks Color Care Protecting Spray","label":"buy-now","event_type_label":"Affiliate","url":true,"product":{"dimension1":"%=href=%","name":"Sparks Color Care Protecting Spray, 3.3 oz.","id":"B00X8JA078","category":"Hair Sprays"},"id":1136474,"location":true}' custom-ga-track=click rel=nofollow>Sparks Color Care Protecting Spray</a> to protect the roots of the wig from getting bleached too.</p><p>To apply the developer, he flipped the wig inside out to expose the inner lace. From there, he used the applicator brush to lay the solution onto the front of the lace, starting at the hairline. “We’re not applying too much pressure because I don’t want it to seep through,” he added. He also recommends applying down to the middle of the lace. This ensures that you have more versatility with styling so no matter how you part the wig, the exposed part has already been customized. Once you’re done applying the color lifter, let it sit for 10 minutes to fully process. However, continue checking the hairline to make sure that color isn’t lifting too much. If you don’t notice a mistake until after you’re done customizing, simply use <a href=# rel=noopener>tint spray</a> or pluck the affected area to correct.</p><h2>Wash and Condition</h2><p>After letting the solution sit for 10 minutes, it was time to rinse off. But instead of simply dousing the unit with water, he applied <a data-pmc-sp-product=a40b7fba6376b7869a39c1298d6da759 href=# custom-ga-data='{"1pd":true,"category":"article-page","details":"purple shampoo","label":"buy-now","event_type_label":"Affiliate","url":true,"product":{"dimension1":"%=href=%","name":"One &#39;n Only Shiny Silver Ultra Conditioning Shampoo, Restores Shiny Brightness to White, Grey, Bleached, Frosted, or Blonde-Tinted Hair, Protects Hair Color - 1 Liter","price":"22.45","id":"B01N9I746J","category":"Shampoos"},"id":1136474,"location":true}' custom-ga-track=click rel=nofollow>purple shampoo</a> on top, lathered, and rinsed. This helps “take the brassiness out and make it more flesh-like.” From there, Anthony saturated the area with the color lifter and rinsed. After that, he went straight into a wash day routine for the wig.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/wig-shampoo.gif><p>The shampoo and conditioning routine allows you to “remove some of the hair plucked before” and ensures that you get all of the loose fibers out. Whereas <a href=# rel=noopener>purple shampoo</a> is best for rinsing out bleaching solution, the type of shampoo and conditioner you use afterward depends on the type of hair you’re customizing. The simplest way to approach <a href=# rel=noopener>cleansing a wig</a> is to treat it the way you would your real hair, while also noting the specific condition of your unit.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/washing-wig.gif><p>For instance, human hair and synthetic hair shouldn’t be treated the same. Anthony says you should “never wash synthetic hair” or bleach the knots. Simply tweeze and use tint spray. Do your research before attempting any of this at home. Also, be sure to detangle as you’re <a href=# rel=noopener>conditioning</a> to make styling easier afterward and to remove any leftover bleach residue.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/plucking-wet-wig.gif><h2>Part, Pluck, and Repeat (Again)</h2><p>Once you’ve rinsed the wig thoroughly, it’s time to pluck again. In my case, Anthony put the <a href=# rel=noopener>wig</a> back on a mannequin head and repeated the same plucking steps from the beginning. Going back in a second time means you can create an even more precise and realistic-looking hairline and/or part since the knots at the base of your wig have been lightened.</p><p>Plus, wet hair is easier to manipulate and a quality wig like those from <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Mayvenn</a> gives you a great starting point anyway. The timing of this step ultimately depends on your end goal, so don’t tie yourself to a specific deadline. For Anthony, this depends heavily on his client’s needs. I wanted my wig to be versatile and something I could part in a couple different ways, so he spent extra time plucking away at different angles.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/wig-drying.gif><h2>Step Away While It Dries</h2><p>Now you get a break! After finishing up the hairline and parts, let the hair dry. Because I was in a salon, she got to sit under a hooded dryer, which I found hilarious and kind-of adorable. If you’re at home, be sure to lay it flat on a towel and hit pause until it’s completely dry.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/applying-wig-lace-tint-spray.gif><h2>Apply Lace Tint Spray</h2><p>Once the wig was dry, Anthony hit the cap with one even layer of <a data-pmc-sp-product=773f570a4c8f40a817ada3ca3322de11 href=# custom-ga-data='{"1pd":true,"category":"article-page","details":"EBIN New York Tinted Lace Spray","label":"buy-now","event_type_label":"Affiliate","url":true,"product":{"dimension1":"%=href=%","name":"Tinted Lace Aerosol Spray - Medium Brown 2.7oz/ 80ml, Quick dry, Water Resistant, No Residue, Even Spray, Matching Skin Tone, Natural Look","price":"9.00","id":"B07YYSBJN7","category":"Hair Sprays"},"id":1136474,"location":true}' custom-ga-track=click rel=nofollow>EBIN New York Tinted Lace Spray</a> , holding the can about six inches away from the hair. Tint spray is what gives the cap a scalp-like finish that leaves onlookers wondering if your wig is real or faux. If you’re dealing with <a href=# rel=noopener>human hair</a>, Anthony recommends lightly tinting your wig every time you shampoo to keep it looking fresh.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/putting-on-wig.gif><h2>Put It On (Finally!)</h2><p>Once the tint spray had a couple of minutes to dry, it was finally time to put the wig on. After securing my natural hair under a <a data-pmc-sp-product=b248db7140b7bca2408b3ce333af1b7e href=# custom-ga-data='{"1pd":true,"category":"article-page","details":"wig cap","label":"buy-now","event_type_label":"Affiliate","url":true,"product":{"dimension1":"%=href=%","name":"eboot 3 Pack Wig Caps (Neutral Nude Beige and Black Mesh)","price":"4.59","id":"B01F4YMT8M","category":"Wig Caps"},"id":1136474,"location":true}' custom-ga-track=click rel=nofollow>wig cap</a> , Anthony placed it on my head. (He also attached a band inside the back of the wig for a more snug fit; just one of the many benefits that come with professional customization.)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/laying-down-wig-hairline.gif><p>After applying <a data-pmc-sp-product=b9a33e0f2933c33c58793591e7f2c5e6 href=# custom-ga-data='{"1pd":true,"category":"article-page","details":"wig tape","label":"buy-now","event_type_label":"Affiliate","url":true,"product":{"dimension1":"%=href=%","name":"36Pieces Wig Tape for Lace Wigs Lace Wig Tape lace front tape wig tape double sided Lace Front Wig Tape Double Sided Waterproof","price":"15.00","id":"B082M21L49","category":"Adhesives"},"id":1136474,"location":true}' custom-ga-track=click rel=nofollow>wig tape</a> underneath the hairline (and away from my edges—phew!), he used a comb and <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">blowdryer</a> to melt down the tape adhesive and set the wig in place. Wig tape is best for short-term wear (about 5 days) while careful <a href=# rel=noopener>glue application</a> is best if you want to keep the wig on your head longer (2-3 weeks).</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/cutting-lace-off-wig.gif><h2>Perform Some Hairline Magic</h2><p>Next, he used <a data-pmc-sp-product=904236e84673b8a9cc84443b83b121be href=# custom-ga-data='{"1pd":true,"category":"article-page","details":"scissors","label":"buy-now","event_type_label":"Affiliate","url":true,"product":{"dimension1":"%=href=%","name":"Hair Cutting Scissors/Shears, Professional Hair Shears - 6.7\" Barber Haircut Scissors For Hair Cutting, Cool Coloring Hair Scissors For Men/Women","id":"B087Z9BHNH","category":"Shears"},"id":1136474,"location":true}' custom-ga-track=click rel=nofollow>scissors</a> to remove the lace from the front of my wig—a step that required sitting very still. “You don’t want to create a straight hairline when you’re cutting lace,” he added. “You want to do it in a curved movement so it looks like your hairline.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/applying-makeup-to-wig.gif><p>From there, he used <a href=# rel=noopener>makeup</a> to help disguise the lace along my hairline and part. Powder or cream is okay to use, though Anthony prefers the latter because he can “control it better.” Use a small brush to hit the hairline and your part, which will also tone down the shininess of <a href=# rel=noopener>wig tape</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/hot-comb-on-wig.gif><h2>Style It Up</h2><p>To wrap things up (though I honestly could’ve watched him play with wigs all day), he used a couple of hot tools and styling products to achieve the throwback glamour I wanted. The <a href=#>hot comb</a> helped to smooth down my roots and a curling wand gave me big, luscious waves.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/wig-styling.jpg><p>And just like that—mission fully accomplished. As you can see, leveling up your custom wig game isn’t for the faint of heart. It takes time, patience, and a penchant for the tiniest of details. I don’t know if I’ll ever have what it takes to do this on my own. If I can leave this part to a salon professional, 9 times out of 10 I will. But if you’re a DIY-er, now you know what you’re in for if you want it to look good good.</p><p>Our mission at STYLECASTER is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do.
