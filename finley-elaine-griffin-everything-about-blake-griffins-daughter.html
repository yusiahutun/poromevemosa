Blake currently plays for the Boston Celtics in the National Basketball Association. Before his NBA career, he played for his college team, the Oklahoma Sooners, where he was named the consensus National College Player of the Year during his sophomore year.</p><p>Finley is the second daughter of Blake Griffin and his ex-fiancée Brynn Cameron, who has gained some attention herself. With her father’s fame and success in the NBA, it’s no surprise that people are curious about this young celebrity. So, what do we know about her?</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Meet_Finley_Elaine_Griffin></span>Meet Finley Elaine Griffin&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/fotor_2023-5-14_16_26_15.jpg><p>Finley Elaine Griffin was born on September 1, 2016, and has quickly become a celebrity in her own right. Her father, Blake Griffin, as stated, is a famous American professional basketball player who competes in the NBA. On the other hand, her mother, Brynn Cameron, is a former basketball player and entrepreneur.&nbsp;</p><p>While it’s unclear when Finley’s parents started dating, they were together for at least five years before moving in together in 2012. The couple had two children and were engaged before their relationship ended in 2017.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Blakes_Reaction_to_Finleys_Birth></span>Blake’s Reaction to Finley’s Birth<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The basketball star didn’t make any public announcements regarding the birth of Finley, unlike his first time being a father. During an interview with GQ, Blake had gushed about becoming a first-time father and how much parenthood has changed him.</p><p>He <a href=#>said</a>,</p><p>“Everyone always says this, and I only partially understand it. People would say, ‘Oh, it’s such a transformative experience. It makes you view things differently.’ I would always respond, ‘Oh yes.’ However, when it occurs, you find yourself exclaiming, ‘Wow. Every single one of those individuals was correct!'”</p>Blake Griffin to GQ<p>Blake added, “I simply feel different, in a sense. I genuinely anticipate moments spent with this tiny individual who cannot speak or care for himself except for chewing and eating.”</p><p>According to his statement, he expressed a deep desire to be present more often in the life of his first child. He said, “I wish I had the opportunity to be around more frequently. The aspect that truly troubles me is being absent for approximately two weeks, relying solely on FaceTime to connect with him. Regrettably, I wasn’t there to witness the first time he rolled over, which might not seem significant, but I felt a strong sense of disappointment at that moment.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Finley_Elaine_Griffin_Isnt_the_Only_Child_of_Her_Parents></span>Finley Elaine Griffin Isn’t the Only Child of Her Parents<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Finley Elaine Griffin is the youngest member of her family. She has an older brother, Ford Wilson Cameron-Griffin, who was born on August 1, 2013, making him three years older than her.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/fotor_2023-5-14_16_27_1.jpg><p>Finley resides in Manhattan with her mother, brother, and half-sibling, Cole Cameron Leinhart, and attends a highly-rated private school. Before Brynn Cameron dated Blake Griffin, she had a relationship with NFL quarterback Matt Leinhart, which resulted in her becoming pregnant with Cole. Though Brynn Cameron and Matt Leinhart’s relationship ended, Cole was born on October 24, 2006, making him the oldest of the three siblings.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Things_Didnt_Work_Out_for_Finleys_Parents></span>Things Didn’t Work Out for Finley’s Parents&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Finley’s parents were set to tie the knot on July 28, 2017, but things took a dramatic turn just a week before the wedding. Rumors circulated that Blake Griffin had called off the wedding, leaving many to wonder what could have happened.&nbsp;</p><p>According to Brynn Cameron, Blake’s ex, the NBA star wanted her to sign a prenup contradicting their oral agreement in 2013. She had agreed to quit her job to raise their kids so he could focus on getting a max NBA contract worth more than $170 million.&nbsp;</p><p>She claimed that signing the prenup denied her meaningful support and share of their property in the event of a divorce. When Cameron refused to sign the papers, the wedding was postponed with just one week’s notice.</p><p>The pair started couples therapy soon after, but Blake immediately began a high-profile affair with model Kendall Jenner. Following the experience, Cameron alleges that Griffin stopped providing her full financial support and share of their joint property. As a result, she sued him for alimony.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/fotor_2023-5-14_16_28_45.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Finley_Elaine_Griffin_Net_Worth></span>Finley Elaine Griffin Net Worth<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>While Finley has no estimated <a href=#>net worth</a>, as she is still very young, her father has an estimated wealth of around $110 million as of 2023. His primary income source stems from his professional basketball player profession. Blake also has a large following of 3.9 million on Instagram.</p><p>While his NBA career is flourishing, he ensures he is part of Finley and her brother’s life. For him, his kids are everything and always come first.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51ks6q6y56wZp2clravsYygqaKelp67brHVnqmyrJieu6h5wJumrqxdl7mit8Rmnquhlpu2r7%2BMnZiun5ipsrN7</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./article-d8f52270-cd6f-11ec-86c8-13430534c1a5-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Fundraisers set at Glade, M&amp;amp;M VFDs | Free News">&larr;
