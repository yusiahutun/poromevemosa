It looks like the ‘hate comments’ have gotten too much for the rapper, who has taken to Instagram to defend himself and his wife.</strong></p><p>The <a href=#>music</a> star finally dropped his new album Vultures, with Ty Dolla $ign after months of delays and impatient fans waiting. However, <a href=#>Kanye West</a> isn’t happy with fans after the drop, as he’s still getting messages questioning the photos of his wife, despite giving them what they wanted.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/02/GettyImages-1938441948-767x1024.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-kanye-west-will-post-his-wife-as-much-as-he-wants-as-he-defends-bianca-photos>Kanye West ‘will post his wife as much as he wants’ as he defends Bianca photos</h2><p>Taking to his 19.4 million <a href=#>Instagram</a> followers, the Touch the Sky rapper posted a video as he walked through the airport with Bianca.</p><p>“Y’all, I just want to tell everybody I posted my wife three times on purpose,” he told the camera, before panning towards her. “I delivered the album. And people still in my comments talking ’bout, ‘Why you posting your wife?’” he exclaimed.</p><p>He then added the simple explanation on why he does so, because she makes him happy.</p><p>“That’s why y’all happy with the music because I’m happy. You understand?” he questioned.</p><p>Ye then told fans to go and f*** themselves if they didn’t like what he was posting. “Seriously, leave me — leave the king — the f*** alone.</p><p>“I don’t care bro. I’m going to post my wife as much as I want. Go post your wife on your f–king Instagram,” West concluded.</p><p>In the video, the 46-year-old could be seen with <a href=#>his titanium dentures</a>, inspired by James Bond <a href=#>movie</a> villain, Jaws.</p><p>Of course, the video was filled with comments, as some were shocked the rapper even takes time to read the comments. “Kanye actually reading comments though??? If you read this, bless me with some Yeezys,” joked one.</p><p>“That’s a laugh of a happy man, amen,” said another, referring to the brief pause he had joking with his wife in between the ‘rant’.</p><p>Others were too focused on his teeth rather than anything he was saying. “Kanye sounding like Mike Tyson with them grills on his teeth,” wrote one.</p><p>Another questioned: “What’s up with his lip?”</p><p><strong>Watch Kanye’s ‘rant’ <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">here</a>.

I was two months from going bankrupt, and I put everything I had into it,” he <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">told</a> TMZ, speaking about his new album, and also mentioning his <a href=#>Yeezy Super Bowl commercial</a>.</p><p>“We moved to Italy. We moved to the factories, and we survived. We survived through the cancellation. We’re back No. 1,” he said.</p><p>However, Kim K’s ex said he ‘doesn’t regret’ his remarks. “They got the right to their opinion — I got the right to my opinion,” he said.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlqX2aAcLfAp7CeZaeawLV5w56dnqaUqHq0tMCroKefXam1sL%2FEZpmimZ6Yrm6vxKeqqKqZYr2pu9OoqmaZnpl6qsDSZqKippRivKd5wq6rnmc%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./book-summary-101-essays-that-will-change-the-way-you-think.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Summary: 101 Essays That Will Change The Way You Think: Philosophical Meditations That Will Change Y">&larr;
