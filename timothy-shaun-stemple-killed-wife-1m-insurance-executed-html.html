serving a life sentence.</span></p><p><span>Hunt is the cousin of Dani Wood, who was having an affair with Timothy Stemple.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Hunt's testimony that the crime was brutal, with Trisha Stemple being conscious during much of the attack, was a factor that helped prosecutors secure the death penalty for Stemple.</span></p><p><span>Hunt struck the woman with a bat twice and her husband hit her in the back of the head about 20 to 30 times, according to Hunt's testimony.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Hunt said Stemple tried to drive over his wife's head with the pickup truck.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Hunt tried to place a wheel on her chest.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Following the initial attack, she managed to drag herself onto grass along the highway after they drove away.</span></p><p><span>In his testimony, Hunt said they returned and struck her with the truck, traveling about 60 mph.</span></p><p><span>A forensic expert consulted by Timothy Stemple's family said the wife's injuries were consistent with being hit by a vehicle and run over but that there's no evidence she was beaten.</span></p><p><span>The medical examiner first thought she died after being hit by a car, but there was 'no primary point of impact below the knees as is usual in the typical auto-pedestrian collision,' prosecutors said in a report in the case.</span></p><p
