Instead, it was because the actor spoke about spending time with the Duke of Sussex. Dominic met <a href=#>Prince Harry</a> 10 years ago while supporting Walking with the Wounded, an organization that supports those who were once in the British Armed Forces who need support. He explained what he had divulged about their time together during a press conference a year later cost him the relationship that the pair shared.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>“I said too much in a press conference so we didn’t speak after that.”</p><p>Stars of the The Crown Dominic West and Jonathan Pryce reveal their run-ins with the royal family, including why one of them is no longer on speaking terms with Prince Harry.<a href=#>@KateEMcCann</a> | <a href=#>@adamboultonTABB</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/iJgCyrLtjp</a></p>— Times Radio (@TimesRadio) <a href=#>December 23, 2023</a></figure><p>View Tweet</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-dominic-west-and-prince-harry-no-longer-speak>Dominic West and Prince Harry no longer speak</h2><p>Talking to Times Radio host Kate McCann, Dominic West said his relationship with Prince Harry diminished when he gave out intimate details of their expedition.</p><p>“Well, that was over 10 years ago, I think that was,” the <a href=#>Netflix</a> star said to which Kate asked: “You still have his number though, surely?”</p><p>“No, we sort of, um…no,” Dominic laughed nervously, “I said too much in a press conference, and so we didn’t speak after that. I think I was asked what we did, what we did to celebrate when we got there and probably said something too much.”</p><p><strong>MORE:</strong> <a href=#>Prince harry breaking royal protocol was ‘agonizing and heartbreaking’ to watch</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-what-did-dominic-say-about-harry>What did Dominic say about Harry?</h2><p>Following the pair’s trip to Antarctica, the <a href=#>TV</a> actor shared that the 39-year-old had quite a knack for building toilets and added the prince would tell “eye-wateringly rude” jokes.</p><p>“They had a flag pole and a loo roll holder that were surrounded by blocks of snow. He must have taken 45 minutes to create each one.”</p><p>Detailing Prince Harry’s work ethic, West explained he would dig holes at his spots of choice adding a &nbsp;“platform to squat on. He built these incredibly intricate ones.” He continued by complimenting his expedition partners’ attention to detail. “He did art A level [in high school] – you can tell he has the artistic touch.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-dominic-turned-down-the-crown-role>Dominic turned down The Crown role</h2><p>West has previously said that he turned down the opportunity to play the <a href=#>royal</a> in the last two installments of the series, but it had nothing to do with Prince Harry. He explained his hesitance saying he believed he looked “nothing like” the monarch as well as doubts about his acting capabilities.</p><p>The <a href=#>celebrity</a> told Entertainment Weekly: “Peter [Morgan] got in touch and I went to see him. This was about a year before we started shooting. He said he’d be interested in me playing Charles and I was quite astonished. I said, ‘You’ve got the wrong guy, I don’t look anything like him.'”</p><p>Dominic <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">continued</a>: “I’d been watching the show, I’d been a fan from the start. I was very conscious of Josh’s amazing performance, and his amazing success, and thought it was a bit of a hiding to nothing to try to follow that.”</p><p>The fear of regret made the 54-year-old change his mind. “I thought about it for several weeks, and it was one of those things you can’t really get out of your head. [I] realized that you’ve got to give it a go because you’ll regret it if you don’t. He’s a fascinating man, Charles, and it’s a fascinating life, and a fascinating role.</p><p>“I mean, apart from anything else, it’s a huge show, and I loved the first four seasons. I realized that I could very happily live with this character for two years.”</p><p><strong>MORE: </strong><a href=#>Prince Harry ‘happy right where he is in Montecito mansion’ not with royals</a></p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmpqX2eFcMDHnmScqp%2Bsu7R5w6ikoqaZmHq4sdKtZKenXaG8r7PEq2StmZygwG7Azmanq6GemLJutMCrqbJlkZvBpr6MoZxmq5GesW7Azqhkpq2TnXw%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./the-meaning-of-a-panel-of-experts-by-jean-michel-basquiat.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The meaning of A Panel of Experts by Jean-Michel Basquiat">&larr;
