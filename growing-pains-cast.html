The series ran from 1985 to 1992 and its seven seasons became one of ABC’s most popular and enduring programs.</p><p>The cast reunited in 2000 for the made-for-TV The Growing Pains Movie, and again in 2004 for Growing Pains: Return of the Seavers. Then, in 2020, 35 years after the sitcom premiered, the actors had a virtual reunion to reflect on their favorite memories from the series.</p><p class=inline-stn-player></p><p>The wholesome, feel-good ‘80s sitcom, famously followed the many misadventures of the colorful Seaver clan who lived in Huntington, Long Island. The Seaver family, led by the affable and wise Dr. Jason Seaver (played by Alan Thicke) and his loving wife, Maggie (played by Joanna Kerns), quickly became a beloved part of households across the nation. Along with their children — Mike (Kirk Cameron), Carol (Tracey Gold), Ben (Jeremy Miller), and the youngest, Chrissy (Ashley Johnson) — they navigated the trials and tribulations of growing up. A little-known Leonardo DiCaprio even joined the cast in the last season, portraying Mike’s homeless friend Luke Brower, who was taken in by the Seaver family.</p><p>(Click through to read about the best<a href=#> 80s TV show stars</a>.)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/10/GettyImages-71463629-edited.jpg><p>Why was the show so successful? In part because <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Kirk Cameron</a> quickly became a teen heartthrob and drew a strong audience. But also the chemistry of the cast made the show TV magic. “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">We were a family</a>,” Cameron told Today.com. “We laughed and cried together, shared birthday celebrations, Christmas parties, holidays and worked together with the crew as a team to make a really special TV show. In many ways, we were a real family.”</p><p>Here, a look back at the Growing Pains cast.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Alan Thicke as Dr. Jason Seaver</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/10/1-4.png><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Alan Thicke</a> was the patriarch of the Seaver family, providing valuable life lessons with humor and compassion. His character, Dr. Jason Seaver, was a psychiatrist who decided to move his successful practice into his home and become a stay-at-home dad to help raise his children while his wife Maggie returns to her job as a reporter. Jason always tries to be there for his family and provide guidance and insight, but finds himself in an array of amusing situations and misadventures while managing the household.</p><p>Thicke starred in all seven seasons of Growing Pains and earned a Golden Globe nomination for his performance.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Thicke outside Growing Pains</h3><p>Born in Ontario, Canada, on March 1, 1947, Thicke got his start hosting the Canadian game show&nbsp;First Impressions&nbsp;in the 1970s. Before landing the career-defining role on&nbsp;Growing Pains, he had his own talk show The Alan Thicke Show, which ran from 1980-1982, followed by Thicke of the Night, which aired in 1983.</p><p>After the success of Growing Pains, he went on to appear in films like Stepmonster, Raising Helen, Alpha Dog,&nbsp;and&nbsp;That’s My Boy. He also had prominent roles on the small screen in shows like&nbsp;Hope & Gloria, Married…with Children, The Bold and the Beautiful, How I Met Your Mother,&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=#>Fuller House</a>. He even hosted the&nbsp;Pictionary&nbsp;game show in 1997.</p><p>Then, in 2014, he starred in the reality show&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Unusually Thicke&nbsp;</a>which focused on his relationship with his third wife, Tanya, and his teenage son, Carter. Thicke had two other sons, Brennan and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Robin</a> (the latter is a singer and songwriter best known for his song Blurred Lines).</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Alan Thicke passed away on December 13, 2016, at age 69,</a> after having a heart attack while playing ice hockey with his son Carter.</p><p><strong>Did you know</strong>? Thicke&nbsp;beat out 150 other actors&nbsp;for the role in Growing Pains.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Joanna Kerns as Maggie Seaver</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/10/2-4.png><p>As the strong and nurturing matriarch, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Joanna Kerns</a> played Maggie, a working mom who manages to balance her career and family. Kearns auditioned opposite Thicke and the duo had instant chemistry which resulted in them landing the coveted lead roles.</p><p>Kerns began her career with guest spots on popular ’70s and ’80s classics&nbsp;like&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Charlie’s Angels</a>, The A-Team, Starsky & Hutch,&nbsp;and&nbsp;Magnum P.I.&nbsp;After Growing Pains she appeared in the shows The Closer&nbsp;and&nbsp;Chicago Hope as well as TV movies Love, Honor & Obey: The Last Mafia Marriage and No One Would Tell. She also appeared in smaller roles in films like Knocked Up&nbsp;and&nbsp;Girl, Interrupted.&nbsp;</p><p>Kerns then turned from acting to directing. Her directing credits included episodes of&nbsp;Grey’s Anatomy,&nbsp;Dawson’s Creek,&nbsp;Pretty Little Liars,&nbsp;<a href=#>This Is Us</a>,&nbsp;ER,&nbsp;Scrubs&nbsp;and&nbsp;Fuller House.&nbsp;</p><p>In September 2017,&nbsp;Kerns told People that she’d been diagnosed with <a href=#>breast cancer</a> and underwent a double mastectomy and was “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">given an all clear</a> — the best of the results I could’ve had.”</p><p>Kerns was married twice; to Richard Kerns from 1976-1985 and Marc Appleton&nbsp;from 1995-2019. She has one daughter, Ashley Kerns.</p><p><strong>Did you know?</strong> Alan Thicke and Joanna Kerns considered dating when they were cast as Jason and Maggie Seaver. Thicke told Huffington Post that they agreed to <a href=#>keep things platonic</a> when they realized how bad their working relationship could become if their romance fizzled.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Kirk Cameron As Mike Seaver</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/10/3-4.png><p>Kirk Cameron’s portrayal of the mischievous and charming Mike Seaver endeared him to fans worldwide and made him an instant heartthrob. He played the rebellious eldest Seaver sibling, who was always getting into trouble and preferred to focus on girls rather than crack open a book and study. Cameron was just 15 years old when he began playing the character. His sister <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Candace Cameron</a> also dominated the small screen, as she famously portrayed D.J. Tanner on&nbsp;Full House.</p><p>After earning teen idol status on Growing Pains, Cameron spent two years on another show, the aptly titled&nbsp;Kirk.</p><p>Cameron’s entertainment work then shifted to be based in his evangelical&nbsp;Christian faith. Since 2000, he has appeared in films with religious themes including&nbsp;Saving Christmas, Fireproof&nbsp;and&nbsp;Left Behind. In 2020 he authored a Christian children’s book As You Grow. Cameron has hosted the Evangelical television show&nbsp;The Way of the Pastor and&nbsp;Takeaways with Kirk Cameron.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Did you know?</strong> Cameron married <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Chelsea Noble</a>, who played his girlfriend Kate on&nbsp;Growing Pains. Together, they have six children, four of whom are adopted.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Tracey Gold as Carol Seaver</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/10/4-4.png><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Tracey Gold</a> portrayed Carol Seaver, the intelligent and determined older sister. Carol is known as the brains of the Seaver clan and is a decorated honor roll student with big aspirations and goals in life. Admired for her brilliance, Carol often wishes to be appreciated for being cute instead, and struggled with self-image issues over the course of the sitcom series.</p><p>Actress Gold, too, dealt with body issues and battled anorexia during the show’s run. She was&nbsp;suspended from the sitcom&nbsp;in 1991 in order for her to manage her health. The experience made Gold an advocate for women’s health and she has been vocal about the dangers of eating disorders. In 2003, she wrote a book&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Room to Grow: An Appetite for Life</a> &nbsp;about her personal experience.</p><p>After Growing Pains, Gold starred in a slew of made-for-TV movies in the ’90s, including&nbsp;For the Love of Nancy, Lady Killer, and Face of Evil. She also appeared in shows like&nbsp;Touched by an Angel and Melissa & Joey. She even starred in the reality series&nbsp;Worst Cooks in America.</p><p>Gold married&nbsp;Roby Marshall&nbsp;in October 1994 after meeting him through TV mom Joanna Kerns. The couple have four sons: Sage, Bailey, Aiden and Dylan.</p><p><strong>Did you know?</strong> Tracey Gold wasn’t the first choice to play Carol. Another actress, Elizabeth Ward, played the character in&nbsp;the unaired original pilot. Gold’s family ended their vacation early in order for her to get a second chance at the role. It worked! Producers replaced Ward with Gold.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Jeremy Miller as Ben Seaver</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/10/5-3.png><p>The rambunctious and mischievous Ben Seaver idolizes his big brother Mike and views him as a role model. The character of Ben brought laughter to the show. He was the youngest until his character’s sister was born on his 12th birthday. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jeremy Miller</a> was only nine years old when he began playing Ben. &nbsp;</p><p>While on Growing Pains, he was also the voice of Linus in multiple&nbsp;Charlie Brown&nbsp;TV specials. He also appeared in episodes of the children’s mystery series Ghostwriter.</p><p>However, Miller only acted sporadically over recent years. He appeared in the reality show Celebrity Fit Club. His most recent credit included a small role in the 2021 film&nbsp;True to the Game.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Did you know?</strong> Miller has been vocal about his <a href=#>struggles with alcoholism </a>which began at a young age. He is open about his sobriety story in an effort to help others and raise awareness.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Ashley Johnson as Chrissy Seaver</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/Copy-of-Copy-of-Copy-of-Copy-of-side-by-side.png><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Ashley Johnson</a> nabbed the role of Chrissy after making her acting debut in the Jean-Claude Van Damme film&nbsp;Lionheart.&nbsp;She joined the cast of Growing Pains in 1990. She was only six, but stayed until the end of the series. The sitcom was a launching pad for the actress. She went on to appear in a number of films including What Women Want, Blindspot, and The Avengers.</p><p>(Read on for 11 of our favorite<a href=#> 80s TV child actors</a>, then and now.)</p><p>Johnson also found success in voice acting.
