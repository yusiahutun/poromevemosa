There is plenty in his favour.</p><br><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">OFFERS OF THE DAY</h3></p><p><strong>Bet UK: Bet £10 Get £30 in Free Bets and Bonuses</strong> - <strong><a href=# aria-label="CLAIM HERE (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">CLAIM HERE</a></strong></p><p><strong>William Hill: Bet £10 Get £40 in Free Bets </strong>- <strong></strong><a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener" href=#><strong>CLAIM HERE</strong></a></p><p><strong>Betfair</strong>:<strong> Bet £10 Get £30</strong> - <strong><a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener">CLAIM HERE</a></strong></p><p><strong>Paddy Power: Bet £20 and get it back as Cash if it Loses</strong> - <strong><a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener">CLAIM HERE</a></strong></p><p><strong>Coral</strong>: <strong>Bet £5 Get £20</strong> - <a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener"><strong>CLAIM HERE</strong></a></p><p><strong>Sky Bet: <strong>Bet £10 Get £30 in Free Horse Racing Bets</strong> </strong>- <strong><a href=#>CLAIM HERE</a></strong></p><p>Bet UK: New customers only. 7 days to deposit and stake £10 minimum bet at odds of 1.5 or greater to qualify.
