'I've not watched it back, but in the moment I don't understand why the linesman or the referee thinks I'm going down there.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I've touched it past him and my foot's in front of the ball, and he hits my leg, and it's clear contact. It's not a penalty but it's 100 per cent a foul for me, but like I said I've not watched it back.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Rashford sparked the comeback for his side, and looked to have put them well on the way to securing their first ever win over Barca at the Nou Camp.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>He beat Marc-Andre ter Stegen at the near post in the 52nd minute to get United back on level pegging, having gone behind just two minutes earlier.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>And the 25-year-old was not alone in his assessment of events, and BT's ex-Man United players-turned-pundits were equally adamant that Rashford had no need to go down as he made his way into the box.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I thought at the time that has to be a foul. Kounde is renowned as one of the best defenders in the world, he had a good World Cup with France but Marcus flies past him, he can't handle him. It's a foul.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'He's tried to go for the ball. It's not as if Marcus dived. That's where the frustration has come from the manager. The manager's really pleased with the way they play but he knows in an instant like that they could have won the game. He should be off really and he's missing for Thursday.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I think he makes a really good point, why would he go down?' began Scholes. 'He's clean through, he's in the form of his life. He's virtually unplayable at the moment, nobody can handle him.&nbsp;</p><img id=i-2759760cb559c3f2 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/02/16/21/67771169-11760527-image-a-16_1676582602547.jpg height=423 width=634 alt="Rashford scored his 14th in 16 games and his fourth goal in as many games on Thursday night" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Rashford scored his 14th in 16 games and his fourth goal in as many games on Thursday night</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'Why would he go down there when he's got a great chance of scoring. He probably would score, the form he's in, but he's a real threat as we said.'&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>And the former United and England midfielder's sentiment was echoed by his old team-mate, who believed the player had done 'the right thing' by forcing the referee into making a decision, but unfortunately went unrewarded.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'It's a foul. I don't think he's trying to play the ball. Both managers were quite frustrated with the referee. The game's played at such a high speed, it's difficult for the referees to keep up.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'Marcus when he's positive and he's making those runs, nobody can live with him, even great athletes like Kounde and Araujo. Xavi will have a slightly different gameplan going back to Old Trafford.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I think he does the right thing. He forces the referee to do his job or the linesman. If the ref can't see it the linesman should do it. He knows there's contact, we know you could see it. Kounde knows he's clipped him.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'In a way, if he doesn't foul him he'll probably score, so at least he gets a shot off. I think in the end for Marcus now, for those Barcelona players, they'll realise that they can't stop him even with fouls they almost can't stop him. Going back to Old Trafford with all those fans behind him and the team, I think they'll feel they can finish the job.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The Red Devils were denied what would have been a memorable victory after Raphinha's cross went straight past David de Gea to make it 2-2.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>And although they came under late pressure with Casemiro almost turning it into his own net and Ansu Fati drawing a good save from the Spaniard, United take a strong position back to Old Trafford for the return fixture.&nbsp;</p><img id=i-b937bbd7c0feb805 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/02/16/21/67771155-11760527-image-a-17_1676582953511.jpg height=423 width=634 alt="The 25-year-old has already matched his previous best tally for an entire season with 22 goals" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>The 25-year-old has already matched his previous best tally for an entire season with 22 goals</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Despite his stunningly rich purple patch in recent weeks, much aspersion has been cast on the decision to play Rashford through the middle by Erik ten Hag, with many believing he is at his most effective coming off the left-hand side.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>So far this season, the 25-year-old has managed to amass 22 goals already in all competitions, matching his previous best tally for an entire season in 2019-20.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>And Scholes was clearly impressed by what he has been seeing of Rashford so far in 2022-23, and claimed that the position he plays in will not stop his fantastic progress.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'Wherever he's playing, whether it's the left, through the middle, on the right, he just looks unplayable.
