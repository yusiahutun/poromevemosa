He has been competing in FIA World Rallycross Championship only since 2011, but his first encounter with driving dates back to his days as a boy.</p><p dir=ltr>The racing star, who lives with his love for speed, already has a daughter, and not many know it.&nbsp;However, he rarely entertains us with information about his personal life. But when he does, he makes it count with a bang.</p><h2 dir=ltr>Tanner Foust’s Daughter</h2><p dir=ltr>The impressive racing driver has a daughter who he likes to keep out of the media. He neither attends many events with his daughter nor he posts pictures with his daughter on social media.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>When it came to light that Tanner has a daughter, the news became the talk of the town as he is very silent about his personal life. Thus, it came as a shocker to all his fans after the news about his daughter came out.&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-191 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span><img alt height=1003 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/liverampup.com/uploads/images/tannerfroust%20daughter.jpg width=600 ezimgfmt="rs rscb1 src ng ngcb1" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><strong>Tanner with his daughter </strong>[Source: pinimg.com]</p><p dir=ltr>It also seems that his daughter’s mother is out of the picture as Foust has decided to keep the information under wraps and has not uttered any information regarding his child’s mother to the media.&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>Well! For now, we have to stay in the dark regarding this subject, as remaining silent about personal affairs happens to be one of the traits that Tanner has mastered. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-192 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2 dir=ltr>His Dating History and Girlfriend: Is Married, Wife?</h2><p dir=ltr>Although Tanner likes to keep much of his personal affairs out of the limelight, he sometimes posts about his lady love on social media.&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>On the occasion of valentine’s day 2021, Foust <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">shared</a> a picture with his girlfriend Alicia Leigh Willis on Instagram, and the caption read-&nbsp;</p><p>Happy Valentine’s Day to this incredible woman!... <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">@alicialeighwillis</a></p><p dir=ltr>Likewise, Alicia also <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">posted</a> a happy picture with Tanner on Valentine’s day, and the caption read-&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>&nbsp;To many more adventures my... <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">@tannerfoust</a> <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">#ensenada</a> <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">#horsepowerranch</a></p><p>Alicia is a common name on social media. She is an American actress and has been appearing on the big screen for a very long time.&nbsp;</p><p>As usual, the professional racing driver had not mentioned a thing about how he met his girlfriend and when they started dating. Despite all that, looking at their social media, it is safe to assume that the couple is enjoying their time with each other and remain totally in love.&nbsp;</p><h2 dir=ltr>Very Different Than His Girlfriend On Social Media&nbsp;</h2><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-193 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span>Unlike Tanner, Alicia is very expressive towards showcasing her love and appreciation towards people that she loves. Apart from her boyfriend Tanner, the actress has a beautiful daughter named Simone in her life, who she usually shares pictures of on her social media.&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>According to a post <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">shared</a> by Alicia on Instagram, her daughter- Simone turned nine years old on February 10th, 2021.&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>Further, the couple loves to travel together. Thanks to Alicia’s active social media presence, we get a glimpse of the couple’s journey every time they go somewhere or do something fun.&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-194 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span>On March 30th, 2021, the beautiful actress <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">shared</a> a glimpse of Foust’s and her’s Arizona adventure together. Likewise, on Alicia’s birthday, the two went on a plane ride at Big Bear Leake, California, together and <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">shared</a> a happy selfie of the two enjoying their special moment. The caption read-&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>Birthday flight with my favorite pilot…&nbsp;</p><p>As for now, the couple is relishing their happy relationship and has not mentioned anything regarding their marriage or engagement. Guess we’ll have to wait for the special occasion to arrive for now!!&nbsp;</p><h2 dir=ltr>Was Previously In A Relationship With A Host?&nbsp;</h2><p dir=ltr>Before his relationship with Alicia, Tanner dated his former girlfriend, Katie Osborne. The gorgeous lady is also a familiar face in the world of TV presenting and hosting. She used to be a d1 swimmer previously. The couple was often seen spending happy time together publicly, and she usually took interviews of the racing star.</p><p dir=ltr>They made an adorable pair in the Global RallyCross fraternity. There were also rumors speculating that the two were living together and were married. However, neither Tanner nor Katie spilled the beans regarding the rumors and their split.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-195 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p dir=ltr>Further, like Tanner, Katie has moved on and is engaged with her partner, Paul Wadensweiler.&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>Katie <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">announced</a> their engagement news via Instagram on January 9th, 2021.&nbsp;</p><h2 dir=ltr>Born to speed, Froust won't be Slowing Anytime Soon</h2><p dir=ltr>“It takes a lot of time but it’s an incredibly fortunate situation and it can all go away very quickly. I think you have to strike while the iron is hot.” - Froust</p><p dir=ltr>Growing up in Scotland, where his stepfather, a US Navy officer, was stationed, Tanner first placed his hand on the steering wheel of a Volvo that was assigned to drop him "to and fro" between school and home. He was thirteen when he got his driving license, and as you can see, there was no turning back for him from that moment onwards.</p><p dir=ltr>“I come in as a racer, with a racing background, where I see things from the driver’s seat. I like performance, and I have fun driving because I am driving at the limit”&nbsp; - Tanner Foust</p><p dir=ltr>From breaking world records, pulling off crazy stunts in the car for many action thrillers to shouldering the obligations of hosting the American version of the reputed show Top Gear, Foust has always found his way into the headlines. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-196 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-643 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmikmauys63MqaypZpOkunCxza2cq6yRnruusc2tZq2ZnqOys3nFqKysrF2drrR5wGabmq2XncGmvoywn6hlmah6qbXSZq6inpVisaLAyKeeZpmemXqotdGlnauhlaOxbrTIrKuoqqlivKd50ZqaoqaXYrGztdWeqWegpKK5</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./fu01o7eijlbkgldeqir9qm2xprl0jct.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Watch Criminal Minds Season 4 Episode 26: ...And Back">&larr;
