I thought you were different. I just get a little upset when I feel like somebody is not being honest with me after I've been honest with them,' he said, insisting he 'didn't mean to yell.'&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'That's not who I am,' he added. 'Just give me a call so we can reschedule everything, and once we do, I can explain to you what type of person I am, and how honest I am, and just cool and calm, and all that fun stuff. So I look forward to talking to you and rescheduling another date with you.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Mason never called him back, which led him to leave her yet another voicemail, this one even angrier than the others. Before playing it, she said it may be her favorite, calling it the 'pièce de résistance.'&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'Why haven't you called me back! How could somebody do that to somebody else?' Brad yelled. 'I've told you that this has happened in the past. You said you weren't going to do it. You said it happened to you and it happened to me. That's why we got along so well.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2>RELATED ARTICLES</h2><ul class="rotator-pages link-xocc"><li class=rotator-prev><a href=# data-page=prev>Previous</a></li><li><a href=# data-page=1>1</a></li><li><a href=# data-page=2>2</a></li><li class=rotator-next><a href=# data-page=next>Next</a></li></ul><ul class="rotator-panels link-bogr1 linkro-ccox"><li><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/09/16/22/48014175-0-image-m-15_1631826437684.jpg width=62 height=60 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <span>Gwyneth Paltrow, 48, admits that her emotions are 'all over...</span></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/09/16/22/48018479-0-image-m-178_1631826042856.jpg width=62 height=60 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <span>Hair-ifying!
