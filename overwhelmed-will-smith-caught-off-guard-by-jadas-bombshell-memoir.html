Laughing, then inspired, then heartbroken. I was all over the place.”</p><p>The <a href=#>Men In Black</a> actor continued: “It’s one thing to hear anecdotes at a family barbeque, but it was truly overwhelming to take in your story [which was] potentially condensed in this way. You are one of one.</p><p>“A blend of power and delicate sensitivity. I know it wasn’t easy to excavate the depths in that way. I applaud and honor you.”</p><p>You can watch the <a href=#>YouTube</a> clip below for the full interview.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p><strong>MORE:</strong> <a href=#>Will Smith’s cryptic move with estranged wife Jada is available for all fans to see</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-jada-s-bombshell-confession-over-tupac>Jada’s bombshell confession over Tupac</h2><p>The <a href=#>Hollywood</a> star admitted in her book that she thinks you can find soulmates in various people, including your children, and that she believed she and the late rapper, Tupac Shakur, <a href=#>went the distance and were soulmates</a>. However, the <a href=#>movie</a> icon was insistent that the pair’s chemistry was strictly platonic and there was nothing romantic there.</p><p><a href=#>The Matrix</a> actress said: “Our children can be our soulmates. I think [there’s] this kind of romanticized idea of, like, a soulmate. You know, there’s all kinds of definitions of soulmate. If there is such a thing as past lives, I definitely think ‘Pac and I have traveled a few together.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-jaden-and-willow-smith-feel-traumatized-by-their-parent-s-marriage>Jaden and Willow Smith feel ‘traumatized’ by their parent’s marriage</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/10/GettyImages-105361200-1024x893.jpg><p>Following the revelations from their mom’s book, it has been claimed by an insider that the pair are<a href=#> both “traumatized’ and “humiliated”</a> by Jada and Will’s relationship. They claimed the <a href=#>celebrity couple</a>‘s turbulent marriage was having a long-lasting effect.</p><p>Talking to the National Enquirer, a source revealed: “Willow and Jaden are both extremely fragile right now and clearly traumatized by their parents’ behavior to the point where they’re acting out. It seems to be having an adverse effect on their kids, too.”</p><p>The source alleged: “Willow is humiliated by the public way her parents have destroyed their marriage and each other, She’s crying out for attention, causing fear for her well-being.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-will-and-jada-have-been-secretly-separated-since-2016>Will and Jada have been secretly separated since 2016</h2><p>Jada has revealed that she and her husband had been separated for six years. Therefore, she was shocked when her estranged husband, whom she attended the Oscars <a href=#>awards show</a> with, slapped that year’s host Chris Rock, and called her his wife.</p><p>In an interview with NBC, Jada said: “First of all, I’m really shocked, because mind you, I’m not there. We haven’t called each other husband and wife in a long time. I’m like, ‘What is going on right now? Keep my wife’s name out of your mouth?’ I’m really worried for Will because I don’t know what’s going on.”</p><p>However, she said that the pair were working on their marriage and she didn’t see divorce as an option.</p><p>She <a href=# rel=nofollow>added</a>: “I made a promise that there will never be a reason for us to get a divorce. We will work through whatever. I just haven’t been able to break that promise.”</p><p><strong>MORE:</strong> <a href=#>Will Smith fans lose their minds after Jada calls him by his real name</a></p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmpoX2aEcLvVnqmwoJWhuqawjLCgpaRdqLqqwMdmmpqtl53BbrvFn2SgrZGnsW6u2GahmpyRqHqju8ybqqGdnKF6rrHMqKCrZw%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./anne-hathaway-couture-week-newsboy-cap-blue-coat-7099119.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Anne Hathaways Latest Outfit Included a Newsboy Cap">&larr;
