Even more, Lexi showed them her “amazing” new girlfriend who she started dating around late April of 2023. So, the name of this person we have come to know is Kristin Zancanelli, AKA Zanc, and we are going to tell you just about her.</p><h3><strong>Meet Kristin Zancanelli, The Ultimatum Star Lexi Goldberg’s Girlfriend</strong></h3><p>In a recent TikTok live, The Ultimatum star Lexi Goldberg offered further clarity about who her new girlfriend is. She said “this person” loves her so fairly and so truly and her name is Zanc. Not stopping there she also gushed that Zanc is a “talented as hell photographer” who has shot every major artist, every celebrity.</p><p>Lexi also added that her partner has worked with talent such as Bella Thorne in the past and that is one of the many reasons she is now just so overwhelmingly happy. “I’m with somebody who has celebrated me for me and gives me a lane to dress however I want to dress and be whoever I want to be. I’ve never felt more comfortable in my skin. It’s the best relationship I’ve ever been in”, Lexi told Bustle recently.</p><p>The Queer Love star also spilled that they were best friends but never opened the door to a potential romance before. After realizing their feelings for each other they not only could not be happier but also have just adopted a dog.</p><p>Lately, on 7 June 2023, Lexi took to her IG story to soft-launch her new partner. She featured some steamy videos of her kissing Kristin with a sticker above them reading “Spoiler Alert”.</p><h3><strong>Kristin Zancanelli Age</strong></h3><p>Kristin Marie Zancanelli was born in 1993. So, she reached the age of 29 in 2022.</p><h3><strong>Kristin Zancanelli Parents</strong></h3><p>Kristin’s mother is Kim Julie Zancanelli and she reached the age of 57 in March 2023.

Zancanelli Jr. He died on 9 January 2022. Fondly known as “Zanc” by friends and loved ones, Gary was the founder and owner of Red Door Woodfired Grill. He launched the first Red Door Grill location in Leawood in 2013. Since then, four other locations in the metro have opened up in Lenexa, Overland Park, Liberty, and Brookside.</p><p>Since March 2020, Gary’s wife Kim also started working as an office manager at Red Door Woodfired Grill&nbsp;in Kansas City, Missouri.
