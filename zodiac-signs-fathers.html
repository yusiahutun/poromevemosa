And because every dad brings something unique and meaningful to the table, it’s time to discuss <a href=#>the TV father that captures each zodiac sign</a>. There’s never been a better time, as Father’s Day is just around the corner, reminding us how much we love and admire the men who have raised us, protected us and provided for us.</p><p>Whether you love your father to pieces or you’re not as close as one would hope, there’s a good chance you were also raised by some of the iconic dads we’ve gotten to know on television. From Danny Tanner’s warm and maternal energy to Uncle Phil’s intimidating, yet protective vibe, each of these fictional fathers shed light on <a href=#>a different type of father</a>. And although they’re all imperfect in their own way, they each carry a set of strengths every father can hope to aspire to. They also have flaws that make them highly relatable, as fathers are only human. Some of these characters may remind you of <a href=#>your own father</a>. Some may have been a safe space for you, making you wish they actually were your father. Either way, these unforgettable TV dads deserve their time to shine.</p><p>In honor of <a href=#>Father’s Day 2023</a>, here’s the TV dad that <a href=#>aligns with each zodiac sign</a> the most:</p><h2>The TV Dad That Matches Each Zodiac Sign</h2><ul class="pmc-fallback-list-items lrv-a-unstyle-list lrv-u-margin-t-2"><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1><h2>Aries: You’re Red Forman</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/1002119736-photo-u1.jpeg><p>Red Forman is the classic Aries, making him brusque, intimidating and a little aggressive. Who could forget his constant threat of putting his foot in his son Eric’s ass? Only a Mars-ruled Aries could manage to be the most alpha and uncouth father in all of TV history and still remain a fan favorite. This cardinal fire sign is straight to the point, just like Red.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1><h2>Taurus: You’re Johnny Rose</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Johnny.Schitts-Creek.webp><p>Taurus is often one of the most reliable, sensible and well-dressed people in the room, which is Johnny Rose to a T. As the head of the Rose family, he’s always managed to remain supportive and faithful to his eccentric wife and his unpredictable adult children, despite his financial woes.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1.5><h2>Gemini: You’re Steve Brady</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Steve-Brady.Sex-and-the-City.webp><p>Every Gemini dad is a charmer at heart, just like Steve Brady. He won over the stoic and avoidant Miranda by insisting that she say “please” and “thank you,” which speaks to his clever way of getting into people’s hearts. And despite his fun, youthful vibe and his humble means, he proves that Geminis can be just as kind and polite as they are devoted when he becomes father to Brady.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1.5><h2>Cancer: You’re Ray Barone</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/35a69e333204c7587e9734c7377a8d13b2e2e6306b6d8c7badb27c64a558d938._RI_TTW_.png><p>Let’s face it—Ray Barone is a bit of a mama’s boy, just like every Cancer son. In astrology, Cancer is ruled by the crab, a shy creature that moves sideways when faced with adversity. Ray is similar in his constant quest to avoid responsibility and dodge his overbearing mother. However, he is also a Cancer in his ability to see the good in everyone.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2.5><h2>Leo: You’re Homer Simpson</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/homer-simpson-driving.webp><p>Despite their bold and flashy reputations, Leos are often lazy lions who would much rather lie around than get up and hunt. Homer Simpson is much the same, as his main M.O. at all times is having fun, enjoying his hobbies and eating yummy food. At the end of the day, that’s all there is to the Leo heart, and although Bart can be Leo in his childlike self-centeredness, he is also a Leo through his generosity.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=0.5><h2>Virgo: You’re Danny Tanner</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Bob-Saget-and-Scott-Weinger-in-Full-House-1987.jpeg><p>Although Danny Tanner may seem chronically uncool to his three daughters, he proves his Virgo status as a single father who always shows up and saves the day. Although he was a bit of a neurotic and a control freak, Danny is the Virgo dad we all wanted *and* needed. He always got the job done and made sure he exceeded every expectation of him as a father.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1><h2>Libra: You’re Mike Brady</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/04_top10tvdads.webp><p>Always brimming with saccharine and uplifting words of wisdom, level-headed Mike Brady is a Libra dad through and through. Not only is he constantly acing the groovy 70’s fashion aesthetic, but he proves his status as a Libra through the pride he takes in his blended family. It’s so Libra of him to define himself as the not only a man with three boys of his own, but a provider and protector to a “very lovely lady who was bringing up three very lovely girls.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1.5><h2>Scorpio: You’re Ray Campbell</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/sister-sister-exclusive.webp><p>Like any Scorpio father, Ray Campbell is a bit of a helicopter parent to his daughter Tamera, but only because these dramatic water signs are always thinking of the worst case scenario. Ray is also a Scorpio in his introverted and artistic quality and in the way he values his privacy, especially in his own house. Who could forget his grumpy way of saying “Go home Roger!”? Plus, the way he dives right in to a power struggle with Lisa Landry is Scorpio to its core.&nbsp;</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1.5><h2>Sagittarius: You’re Frank Costanza</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/sddefault.jpeg><p>If any zodiac sign is gonna cut through the awkward silence and point out the obvious, it’s a Sagittarius. Frank Costanza is no different, as the father of George is always loud, opinionated and incapable of keeping things chill. Like any Sagittarius, their overzealous energy is always coupled with their borderline nihilistic attitude towards life. Sounds a bit like Frank Costanza.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2><h2>Capricorn: You’re Philip Banks</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Screen-Shot-2023-06-15-at-10.58.38-PM.png><p>If anyone is going to enforce and uphold status and decorum, it’s a Capricorn. Uncle Phil is the Capricorn of all Capricorns, as his structured lifestyle and continued professionalism is always one frustration away from reaching their breaking point. However, he’s also the perfect example of divine masculine energy, as he may be tough on the outside, but his heart is massive on the inside.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1.5><h2>Aquarius: You’re Bob Belcher</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/bob-belcher-bobs-burgers-favorite-tv-father-figure.jpeg><p>As the third-generation business owner of his family-operated restaurant Bob’s Burgers, Bob Belcher is always eager to experiment with new culinary techniques and business models. Like any Aquarius father, this Bob is eccentric, innovative and a bit pessimistic in the way he parents his kids and supports his wife. While other TV dads may look like they have their sh*t together, this Aquarius dather is an authentic and lovable anti-hero.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2><h2>Pisces: You’re Michael Bluth</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/arrested-development-season-5-jason-bateman-michael-netflix.webp><p>Pisces folk are kind-hearted and empathetic, but they can lean too much into their own fantasies. Enter Michael Bluth, a man who always tries to be there for his family, but has a lot of trouble paying attention long enough to listen to his son George Michael when he’s talking to him. Pisces folk can be selfless to a fault and Michael Bluth’s martyr complex has Pisces written all over it, even if he’s more spaced out than he realizes. Plus, it’s not hard to imagine a Pisces parent following their kid all the way to college.</p></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57xpqjpZ2irny7u8OimJxlo560r7%2BMn5itoJWnwHA%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./21-captivating-facts-about-ellen-dow.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="21 Captivating Facts About Ellen Dow">&larr;
