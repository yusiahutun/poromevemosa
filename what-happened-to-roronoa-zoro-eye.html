He stands as a symbol of strength, determination, and companionship.&nbsp;</p><p>Created by the imaginative <a href=# rel=noopener>Eiichiro Oda,</a> Zoros’ journey embarks with his encounter with Straw Hta Pirates, a crew led by the spirited Monkey D. Luffy.&nbsp;</p><p>Zoros’ unwavering dedication and loyalty to his friends shine as he becomes the crew’s first member after being saved from execution.</p><p>As a highly skilled swordsman, Zoros’ mastery of his blades sets him apart as one of the crew’s primary combatants.</p><p>The fighter Zoros’ character evolution and development speak to Odas’ attention to detail. Initially, Oda visioned Zoror as a wielder of two swords.</p><p>However, Zoros’ iconic three-sword style has solidified his distinct fighting style. His hardship has often proved Zoros’ unwavering dedication to becoming the greatest swordsman.</p><p>Despite being a great combat, Zoros’ big scar on his eye has stolen the attention of fans. The reason and theory behind his scar has become a mystery to many more.</p><h2>What Happened To Roronoa Zoro Eye?</h2><p>A central mystery surrounding Zoro revolves around the scar over his left eye. This intriguing scar comes into view after a two-year gap in the anime’s timeline.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/hot-take-zoro-losing-his-eye-is-simply-a-design-choice-v0-cnliay2hrapa1.jpg><p>The sudden change in his appearance has sparked curiosity and speculation among fans.</p><p>However, as of the present, the official storyline has not yet disclosed the circumstances behind Zoros’ eye injury.</p><p>The unanswered question of what happened to Roronoa Zoro eye has given rise to several fans theories.</p><p>One prevailing theory suggests that Zoros’ scar may have resulted from an accident during training under Dracule Mihawk.</p><p>Similarly, another interesting theory links Zoros’ ocular dominance. The imbalance between his eyes contributes to his difficulty in maintaining a sense of direction.</p><p>His inability to navigate direction even in familiar places gives viewers laughter. However, now it has been linked to the mysterious scar on his eye.</p><p>Some even came up with the captivating notion that says Zoros’ <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">eye scar may relate to his cursed swords and the entity of Asura.&nbsp;</a></p><p>While these theories offer a convincing explanation, it is yet to be confirmed by the writer himself.</p><p><strong>Also Read: </strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Tupac Shakur Net Worth: Career, Lifestyle & Death</a></p><h2>How Did Zoro Lose His Eye?</h2><p>Zoro, one of the strongest swordsmen from One Piece, had an important journey on Kuraigana Island after a 2-year gap.</p><p>He learned under Dracule Mohawk, a powerful swordsman. During the training, <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Zoro got even better with his swords and learned a special power called Haki</a>.</p><p>However, something happened to his left eye, leading to a big scar. The story doesn’t reveal exactly what happened.</p><p>When Zoro returned to his friends, they were surprised by his new look with the scar over his eye. Fans have been guessing about this ever since.</p><p>Even a close friend of the creator of One Piece asked about Zoros’ eye. But the creator didn’t give a clear answer.</p><p>This makes fans think there might be something special about Zoros’ eye. Some fans think opening that eye could unlock powerful abilities, like a hidden demon power.</p><p>But there’s also a chance that the scar might not have a big meaning. It could be just an injury from his intense training.</p><p>The creator might choose not to discuss it more if it’s unimportant in the story. Whether the scar gives Zoro special power or not, it’s a significant part of his journey.</p><p>Fans are excited to know more, especially now that the One Piece story is approaching its big finale.</p><p><strong>Also Read: </strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Is Jannik Sinner Gay Or Does He Have A Girlfriend?
