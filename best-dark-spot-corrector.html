Like many antagonizers, once excess melanin forms on the skin's surface and dark spots appear, they're in no rush to leave. The overproduction of melanin is your body’s natural defense against aggravating environmental situations, like UV radiation, or lifestyle shifts, like stress or acne, but it takes something stronger than sunscreen to reduce the appearance of hyperpigmentation.<span class=ql-inline-citation data-cite=1></span></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Brimming with patience and determination, we decided to fight the good fight against hyperpigmentation by testing the most popular dark spot correctors, from vitamin C serums to at-home peel pads, on our own spotted skin for the next 12 weeks. Our team of InStyle editors spanned a wide range of ages, skin types, concerns, and textures, evaluated each one, starting with how long it took to visibly zap our marks and the extent to which our spots disappeared at the end of the 12-week trial. We asked ourselves if the product evened out our complexions’ tone and texture and whether our skin looked more plump and firm. Then we scored and ranked each one to curate this list of the very best, most effective options to brighten your complexion.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-pca-skin-hydroquinone-free-pigment-gel-face-serum></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Overall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>PCA SKIN Hydroquinone-Free Face Serum</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="PCA SKIN Hydroquinone-Free Pigment Gel Face Serum" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/-reJiFvwQ2M-LFFP3SQwflcigeQ=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/pca-skin-hydroquinone-free-pigment-gel-face-serum-hydroquinone-free-pigment-gel-face-serum-a763542ab07c4f29b2c8ac198c7d386a.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>PCA SKIN</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The super effective formula ditches super harsh ingredients in favor of soothing ones, such as fruit extracts, to mollify our angry, irritated skin and effectively banish dark spots, acne, and uneven texture quicker than we expected.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The formula may leave behind a subtle tingling sensation if it’s applied over broken areas of skin.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We had high, arguably unrealistic, expectations entering this test, and a long list of what we wanted from a dark spot corrector, including everything from fading stubborn acne scars to balancing our complexion’s texture and tone. Oh, and we wanted these wishes granted fast — to our delight, the PCA Skin Hydroquinone-Free Pigment Gel Face Serum fulfilled our dreams on all of these fronts.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We knew it was a winner from the start when the witch hazel and lactic acid immediately made our complexions appear more radiant and firm, and, since lactic acid is a much milder exfoliator (it’s even safe enough to treat the symptoms of rosacea), it didn’t cause our sensitive skin to react.<span class=ql-inline-citation data-cite=2></span> Instead, these antioxidants helped maintain moisture and worked alongside the other mild alpha hydroxy acids (AHAs) like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>kojic acid</a> to turn over dead cells while replenishing our skin with hydration, leaving it softer and smoother.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">In fact, despite the gentle formula, we saw quicker results with this corrector than most of the other treatments we ever tried — as in two weeks fast, a short time compared to most formulas. Of course, we partially credit these results to our diligent use, never skipping a single morning or nighttime application through the full three months of testing.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Still, we’re glad we stuck around because after six weeks our blemishes and acne scars had disappeared and we started to see the dark spots around our cheeks fade. Surely, the game-changing results are partially thanks to the formula’s use of phenylethyl resorcinol, a relatively new whitening agent derived from pine bark.<span class=ql-inline-citation data-cite=3></span> It’s over 20 times more potent than kojic acid at inhibiting tyrosinase, the enzyme responsible for pigmenting skin and causing dark spots, and has higher antioxidant activity than vitamins E and C.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Yet, what was more surprising was how well the formula cleared up our acne in spite of the fact that we stopped using our prescribed tretinoin. As we braced ourselves for an expected breakout, like around the time of our menstrual cycle, we were overjoyed when our skin remained as clear as ever.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">As it turns out, research shows that azelaic acid works just as well in controlling acne, if not better, than tretinoin, and it’s less abusive, meaning not only were we experiencing fewer breakouts, but our skin was less aggravated, too.<span class=ql-inline-citation data-cite=4></span> Also, silybum marianum fruit,&nbsp; a plant-based extract that mitigates oil production, also helped inhibit new pimples from emerging, contributing to our renewed, refreshed complexions.<span class=ql-inline-citation data-cite=5></span></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Truthfully, the only time we experienced discomfort was when we accidentally layered the serum across broken skin, so we learned to keep it away from any fresh cuts and only use it as a spot treatment on problem areas.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Key Ingredients: </strong>Azelaic acid, kojic acid<strong> | Product Type: </strong>Serum<strong> | Benefits: </strong>Evens skin tone, clears acne, firms <strong>| Size: </strong>1 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-versed-out-of-sight-dark-spot-gel></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Budget</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Versed Dark Spot Gel</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Versed Out of Sight Dark Spot Gel" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/Tb3PeCm3Obu51wy2RXa6BBAIaCg=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/versed-out-of-sight-dark-spot-gel-11d67b2b3b6745bd83812c527db66f21.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Versed&nbsp;Skin</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>Between in-office visits and high-tech laser treatment,<strong> </strong>getting rid of dark spots can be costly but this gel showed favorable results for less than $20.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The formula takes a long time to absorb into the skin.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We won’t lie: It takes an aggressive approach to get rid of dark spots,often requiring expensive treatments and sometimes even multiple rounds of these treatments, so you can imagine our delight when this drugstore formula delivered exceptional results. Seriously, we noticed a reduction in our redness and hyperpigmentation soon after application, and an instant brightening effect that made our skin look like it was bathed in the soft lighting of an intimate dinner party.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">As luck, or science, would have it, the formula uses licorice root extract, which contains the chemical compound glabridin. This herbal remedy has quite the reputation for eliminating discoloration as it guards the skin against UVB-induced hyperpigmentation by dispersing the over-production of melanin and inhibiting unstable atoms known as free radicals from wreaking havoc (read: breaking down collagen) on otherwise healthy cells.<span class=ql-inline-citation data-cite=6></span></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">However, all good things take time, and our best skin yet was just around the corner. Around three weeks into treatment, the niacinamide calmed our rosacea-induced inflammation and the intensity of our breakouts subsided. Essentially, the vitamin B3 derivative acts as a blocker between keratinocytes, a cell found in the upper layer of the skin, and another one called melanocytes, regulating the signals in our skin calling for an increased transfer of melanosomes — AKA skin pigments.<span class=ql-inline-citation data-cite=7></span></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It worked in tandem with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>tranexamic acid</a>, an ingredient that’s shown promise in recent years to treat post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation and led us to see a significant reduction in dark spots by the end of our 12-week testing period.<span class=ql-inline-citation data-cite=8></span> Not bad for treatment you can add to your cart while also shopping for toothpaste and paper towels, right?&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">From its price to the proven, science-backed formula, this gel corrector showed up in some big ways, but if we’re getting nitpicky, we didn’t totally love how we had to wait a bit for its tacky residue to completely sink into our skin. Thankfully, the stickiness didn’t linger after the gel absorbed or caused our makeup to pill.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Key Ingredients: </strong>Tranexamic acid, kojic acid, niacinamide, licorice root extract <strong>| Product Type: </strong>Gel<strong> | Benefits: </strong>Brightening <strong>| Size: </strong>0.5 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-body-citygoo-dark-spot-remover-for-face-and-body></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Body</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>CITYGOO Dark Spot Remover</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="CITYGOO Dark Spot Remover for Face and Body" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/z9ni79TPNQiXQf72jmWbNKPYm-4=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/citygoo-dark-spot-remover-for-face-and-bod-3d4e50a490914b4aa15276b808b4ca7d.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It became an act of self-care to slather this lightweight, non-oily dark spot cream across our face, arms, and chest every day as we sat back and relaxed while it subtly faded dark spots on our chest and arms with a cooling formula.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It takes a longer time to see results compared to other treatments we’ve tried.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Whether we blame genetics or how we’ve become lax about applying sunscreen as assiduously below the neck as we do to our face, sometimes dark spots have a tendency to show up on different parts of the body — an issue the CityGoo dark spot thought ahead to alleviate with its lightweight, cushiony cream corrector.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The formula spread like butter across every inch of our skin, from our decolletage to our inner arms, without ever feeling sticky. Additionally, it has a very mild, almost imperceptible smell that didn’t interfere with the scent or texture of any of the other lotions, perfumes, and body soaps we spritzed and buffed into our skin throughout the day.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">However, texture aside, right off the bat, we could feel the cooling and soothing effects of the gentian scabra root extract, a medicinal plant, that mitigated our redness and, with time, the post-inflammatory reactions that caused dark spots.<span class=ql-inline-citation data-cite=9></span> We guess time really does heal all wounds because it took a little over a month before we started to see some other noteworthy positive changes from ingredients such as nicotinamide, a form of vitamin B-3, and vitamin E.<span class=ql-inline-citation data-cite=10></span> Both vitamins tout photoprotective properties that help guard skin against dark-spot-inducing UV rays. Meanwhile, citric acid functioned as a non-irritating AHA that sloughed off dead skin cells, taking our uneven, rough texture with it.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The formula is also stuffed with moisture replenishing ingredients, like hydrolyzed rice protein, to prevent dehydration. This little protein has also been shown to reduce tyrosinase activity that leads to melanin production. Panthenol is another skin-softening ingredient that pulls double-duty by nourishing the skin while delivering healing properties that can fade the look of acne scars and other marks.<span class=ql-inline-citation data-cite=11></span></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Key Ingredients: </strong>Gentian scabra root extract, tranexamic acid, nicotinamide, vitamin E,squalane<strong> | Product Type: </strong>Cream <strong>| Benefits: </strong>Brightening, smoothing<strong> | Size: </strong>1.7 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-acne-scars-fenty-skin-watch-ya-tone-5-niacinamide-dark-spot-serum-with-vitamin-c></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Acne Scars</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Fenty Skin Watch Ya Tone 5% Niacinamide Dark Spot Serum</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Fenty Skin Watch Ya Tone 5% Niacinamide Dark Spot Serum with Vitamin C" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/ITcxtVdvkabvLSbaP3GNznMeWMA=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/fenty-skin-watch-ya-tone-5-niacinamide-dark-spot-serum-with-vitamin-c--42610ee16bf246f296d7d4cde12eec9f.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Fenty Skin&nbsp;</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The Fenty Dark Spot Serum softened acne scars by healing damaged skin and plumping it with hydrating, skin-strengthening ingredients like Barbados cherry.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It leaks out of the bottle if you’re not careful about storing it upright.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We knew Fenty had our backs when it came to concealing and correcting with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>beloved foundations and setting powders</a>. Yet, little did we know that the brand could do so much more than simply cover up our acne scars — it can eliminate them completely, all while giving our skin that signature Fenty glow, sans any actual bronzer.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The formula achieved this in a couple of different ways.&nbsp; First, it used five percent niacinamide, a percentage studies have shown to be a much more effective amount at treating hyperpigmentation, to lighten the skin.<span class=ql-inline-citation data-cite=12></span> Then, the formula combined Barbados cherry, one of the most abundant sources of ascorbic acid (aka vitamin C), with licorice root extract to vigorously brighten our skin without triggering a hint of irritation.<span class=ql-inline-citation data-cite=13></span></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">As a refresher, vitamin C is high on the list of potent antioxidants, and, fun fact, it’s also a primary replenisher of vitamin E, making it a super powerful competitor against the effects of oxidative stress, like overexposure to solar radiation.<span class=ql-inline-citation data-cite=14></span> Notably, it’s an A+ addition to any formula aiming to target acne scars since it increases collagen production, a protein necessary for rebuilding the skin barrier, healing it and making it stronger in the process.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Though technically this is a serum, between its creamy texture and thicker viscosity, we’d best describe its consistency as a thinner, more flexible face moisturizer. Translation: The product stayed put wherever we applied it without running down our faces (though it did leak out of the bottle a bit), and it only took about one pump to efficiently cover four different areas of our faces.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Naturally, the brand behind our most glam beats wouldn’t make a skin product that didn’t play nicely with our makeup, and we found the serum to layer like magic under our foundation, concealer, and blushes. Its thin, slightly tacky texture actually doubled as a mattifying base for makeup, holding them in place and allowing us to blend products into a seamless finish.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Key Ingredients: </strong>Niacinamide, vitamin C, licorice root extract, Barbados cherry <strong>| Product Type: </strong>Serum <strong>| Benefits: </strong>Brightens, evens skin tone<strong> | Size: </strong>1 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-dark-under-eyes-hero-cosmetics-lightning-wand-dark-spot-brightening-serum></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Dark Under Eyes</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Hero Cosmetics Lightning Wand</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Hero Cosmetics Lightning Wand Dark Spot Brightening Serum" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/6ofZX8ORxG2_kyZYSbffI7wT-78=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/hero-cosmetics-lightning-wand-d7e1976b60d2406c84f3166bba01b0e0.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Hero Cosmetics</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>Unlike a traditional drop applicator, the Hero Cosmetics wand used a metal ball applicator that allowed us to apply the antioxidant-rich serum close to the creases of our under eyes without worrying about irritation</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>Finding out how to dispense the serum from the applicator isn’t totally intuitive.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">In our experience, Hero Cosmetics is true to its name, swooping in to help us with our biggest skin woes. We’ve used it to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>rid our pores of blackheads with clay masks</a>, and pull grime out of our noses with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>pimple patches</a>. And while we saw instant results with those two heroes (pun intended), this serum is the full marathon: A longer process, but ultimately more rewarding with longer-lasting effects, especially when it comes to diminishing dark circles.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">At the starting line of this serum’s brag-worthy qualities is the applicator. Yes, it took us a few tries to learn how to use it (you need to press a small button to release the product, but it totally blends into the wand’s white packaging), but once we jumped over that hurdle, it was off to the races. We loved the metallic rollerball applicator for the smooth, cooling effect. This cool zing definitely woke us up in the morning, but it also made us look more awake and far less puffy, while the lightweight serum filled with glycolic acid, which also delivered a zing to our body in the form of speeding up collagen production to improve discoloration.<span class=ql-inline-citation data-cite=15></span></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Additionally, willow bark, vitamin C, and licorice root all contributed to our brighter skin, and, over time, we noticed an increased firmness to our complexions, which we didn’t expect, but we’ll definitely take.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Meanwhile, the algae extract gently exfoliated away dry flakes, leaving our skin smooth and even.<span class=ql-inline-citation data-cite=16></span> In tandem, an ingredient we had never heard before, called acetylglucosamine, worked as a mighty force to lessen melanin production and to repair wounds, and over time, we saw our most intense acne scars begin to fade.

After our testing time was up, we can absolutely say our goals were met — and then some. Our first impression was the texture — it really wowed us.

And, do we dare say that the kojic acid and niacinamide left our skin with an unmatched luminosity that only the most pigmented highlighters can rival? It also could have been the allantoin, an emollient and chemical compound borrowed from plants, that softened our skin and gave our tired appearance a glow-up.<span class=ql-inline-citation data-cite=18></span></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-49 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When it came down to tackling our spots, the formula tapped a couple of heavy hitters — tranexamic acid and HEPES (Hydroxyethylpiperazine Ethane Sulfonic Acid) — to balance the pH of our skin, stopping it from overproducing pigment and excess oil to keep our pores clear and future spots at bay. One downside to using the serum is the bright orange hue. Surprisingly, it sinks right in without leaving any color behind, but we can’t say the same for our pajamas.

And it’s about time, considering darker skin tones are more vulnerable to developing discoloration but are often left out of the conversation when it comes to treatments. Many popular dark spot correctors contain hydroquinone, a lightening agent that can leave a bleached ‘halo effect’ around the dark spot, thereby exacerbating the problem it's trying to solve.<span class=ql-inline-citation data-cite=19></span> Eadem was founded as a solution: A science-backed brand developed by women of color chemists, approved by women of color dermatologists and tested across a range of skin tones, yet this milky serum is richly nourishing and effective for all.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-55 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Without hydroquinone, Eadem uses Smart Melanin Technology, a proprietary blend of niacinamide, amber algae, and vitamin C to safely exfoliate, reduce inflammation, and gently lighten discoloration.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-56 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We knew we were in great hands with this serum. Its milky consistency felt light and hydrating, and our sensitive, reactive skin didn’t flare up once. Still, we started slow with three drops, but after three weeks and nothing but dewy skin, we doubled it to six drops, which fast-tracked our impressive results. Our complexion showed significant progress: Breakouts became fewer and farther between, scars started to disappear, and our complexion looked even.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-57 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">What’s more, the slightly thicker serum was easy to spread across our entire face without dragging over our rough patches or pilling up in drier spots. Eventually, we only used it as a spot treatment for our dark spots as our skin started to look better, and better. However, no matter where we applied it, how we got it out of the dropper was always a bit difficult since the brand designed the dropper at a funky angle that took some finagling to remove from the small opening in the bottle.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-58 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Key Ingredients: </strong>Niacinamide, amber algae, vitamin C, and licorice root<strong> </strong>|<strong> Product Type: </strong>Serum | <strong>Benefits: </strong>Minimizes appearance of pores, soothes inflammation&nbsp; |<strong> Size: </strong>1 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-anti-aging-neutrogena-rapid-tone-repair-retinol--vitamin-c-dark-spot-corrector></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Anti-Aging</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Neutrogena Rapid Tone Repair Dark Spot Corrector</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Neutrogena Rapid Tone Repair Retinol + Vitamin C Dark Spot Corrector" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/6ZBvuwQ_RINeJec-nGpRPhND_fw=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Neutrogena-Rapid-Tone-Repair-Dark-Spot-Corrector-Serum-9a09ce5fd88a49bc926852e2c05bb04c.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The formula balances retinol with an impressive amount of hydrating ingredients so we can reap the benefits of the all-star exfoliator while enjoying the moisture-replenishing advantages of hyaluronic acid.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>Layering too many heavy foundations and face lotions on top of the serum caused it to pill.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-62 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Neutrogena was right on the money with the inclusion of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>retinol</a> in its bestselling dark spot corrector. This vitamin-A derivative blocks melanin from reaching the skin’s surface, which prevents more spots from forming while strengthening the skin barrier.

Our fear of dry patches or flakiness popping up never came true. In fact, we actually found the formula to be so well-balanced that we increased our dosage from the suggested pearl-sized amount to a dime-size without any negative reaction. Still, we always, always recommend proceeding with caution if retinol makes you weary.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-64 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">But that’s not all: The antioxidant hydrolyzed Myrtus communis leaf extract smoothes the look of our fine lines.<span class=ql-inline-citation data-cite=20></span> We’re also prone to puffiness in the morning (who isn’t, really), but we noticed that we were waking up without looking like we just woke up. Then we learned this plant extract has antibacterial properties great for dissolving excess oil and dead skin cells on the skin’s surface, which not only prevents acne but also ensures a brighter glow.<span class=ql-inline-citation data-cite=20></span></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-65 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">On another note, for the most part, these lightweight ingredients layered seamlessly with the products we blended on top of it. We only noticed some pilling when we really got glammed up and layered a full face of makeup on top of it, but even still, this became a non-issue when we took the time to wait a little longer for the serum to sink in before moving on to the next step in our routine.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-66 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Key Ingredients: </strong>Retinol, vitamin C, and hyaluronic acid<strong> | Product Type: </strong>Serum <strong>| Benefits: </strong>Evens skin tone |<strong> Size: </strong>1 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-brightening-veracity-brightening-support></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Brightening</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Veracity Brightening Support</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Veracity Brightening Support" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/LcGlcIwHb0ZfPJkD2ktGqroCtUk=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/veracity-brightening-support-2d124b9b54dd4e1798ba4af9fb2f8904.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Saks Fifth Avenue</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>Our skin drank up this serum the same way we gulp down an electrolyte drink after a tough workout,&nbsp; reinvigorating our skin, rewarding it with a more even texture and fewer breakouts.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It’s a little sticky at first.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-70 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Every bit of our experience with the Veracity Brightening Support was a deluxe experience, from pulling the gleaming gold dropper out of the very zen-looking forest green bottle to the way our skin soaked up the light, water-based formula like liquefied sunshine. Truly, we didn’t even mind that it was a little sticky; we happily waited a few extra minutes waiting for it to dry. Then one morning when we were in a particular rush, we realized this tackiness had the hidden benefit of doubling as a fantastic face primer, keeping our makeup in place.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-71 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Whether we were standing in direct sunlight or sitting in the darkest restaurant, the skin-brightening ingredients gave our complexions a luminosity and an undeniable glow. Unlike traditional vitamin C formulas that can irritate the skin, this one uses a more stable derivative known as ascorbyl glucoside. This skin absorbs this variation super slowly, preventing potential irritation and it meant that we never experienced an uncomfortable tingling feeling some harsher formulas leave behind.<span class=ql-inline-citation data-cite=21></span></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-72 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">However, we will say that using this serum in combination with our prescribed azelaic acid and tretinoin didn’t do our dehydrated skin any favors. However, we found it to be far less drying when we decreased application to only once in the morning, instead of twice a day. Potentially, this impacted the rate at which we saw our results, but rest assured the brightening effects still shone through.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-73 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Our little dose of sunshine had some assistance from ferulic acid, a powerful antioxidant found in plants known for fighting free radical damage that leads to acneic skin and for healing acne wounds.<span class=ql-inline-citation data-cite=22></span> Yet, even when we did get the inevitable blemish, the serum sped up the recovery process and our pimples didn’t look quite as angry or red as usual. Working in tandem is gallic acid, a plant-based ingredient known for its brightening properties, brimming with a ridiculous concentration of phenolic acids, which is basically the heavyweight champion of fighting inflammation and bacteria growth. It’s so effective that it can even match hydrocortisone when treating the severe red, itchy symptoms associated with atopic dermatitis.<span class=ql-inline-citation data-cite=23></span></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-74 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">As a bonus, we barely used any product to see these results because we only needed to apply a small drop of the serum to see it spread evenly across our problem areas.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-75 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">What we really found interesting, however, is that continued use of gallic acid inhibits tyrosinase generation — AKA: it stops melanin transfer to skin cells — and has been proven to drastically improve the brightness of skin while reducing dark spots.<span class=ql-inline-citation data-cite=24></span></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-76 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Key Ingredients:</strong> Vitamin C, garland lily extract, hyaluronic acid, gallic acid, ferulic acid, vitamin E <strong>&nbsp;</strong>| <strong>Product Type: </strong>Gel <strong>| Benefits: </strong>Brightens, protects, hydrates | <strong>Size: </strong>0.5 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-hydrating-hyper-skin-hyper-even-brightening-dark-spot-vitamin-c-serum></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Hydrating</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Hyper Skin Hyper Even Vitamin C Serum</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Hyper Skin Hyper Even Brightening Dark Spot Vitamin C Serum" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/tqdr7_Oy6xYUanfdv9tKBGejypI=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/hyper-skin-brightening-dark-spot-vitamin-c-serum--121d03c4615542f2b47204d45bef1a3e.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>Flaky, dry rough patches ceased to exist while we used this serum, thanks to a couple of moisture-replenishing and skin-plumping ingredients, hyaluronic acid and lecithin.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>There was some sticky residue left over from the application.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-80 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Right off the bat, we could tell this serum was drenching our skin with an IV drip of nourishing, hydrating ingredients, just based on the immediate, next-level glow it gave us.

The fatty acid plumps skin, protects it from external damage and strengthens the skin barrier so that new dark spots are less likely to crop up. The formula also contains more moisture-rich ingredients such as glycerin, hyaluronic acid, and a bountiful of fruit extracts to ensure you have your softest skin yet.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-83 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Interestingly enough, in addition to kojic acid, salicylic acid is another key ingredient in the formula that we’re used to seeing in our acne cleansers and spot treatments, and we were delighted to learn it’s also a defender against dark spots. As an exfoliator, it can penetrate the skin quicker to turn over dead skin cells and help heal acne scars. Salicylic acid is also an anti-inflammatory and has been shown to have a lightening effect on the skin.<span class=ql-inline-citation data-cite=25></span></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-84 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Subtly, but surely, we watched the formula reward our skin and it only took around three weeks to notice more significant changes with a smoother, less textured skin tone and a decrease in dark spots.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-85 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Key Ingredients: </strong>Vitamin C, hyaluronic acid, and kojic acid <strong>| Product Type: </strong>Serum | <strong>Benefits:</strong> Reduce breakouts, evens skin tone <strong>| Size: </strong>1 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-acne-prone-skin-dr-barbara-sturm-untinted-clarifying-spot-treatment></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Acne-Prone Skin</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Dr. Barbara Sturm Untinted Clarifying Spot Treatment</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Dr. Barbara Sturm Untinted Clarifying Spot Treatment" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/Xa1fdoVlnClWeoaU6E-iUwI3g6o=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/sephora-dr-barbara-sturm-untinted-clarifying-spot-treatment-efc79fee21f34ce8bd43fe933e4dbedb.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>A host of non-irritating, plant-based anti-bacterials cleansed our skin to curb bacteria growth and oil production that causes breakouts.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It contains talc, a sometimes irritating ingredient found in many cosmetics and household products.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-89 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">From the tiniest pimple to larger breakouts, this Clarifying Spot Treatment from Dr. Barbara Sturm was ready to wage war against stubborn acne and banish it for good.

Although it’s quite effective on its own to tackle acne, it’s even more potent when it's used alongside the naturally purifying tea tree oil, which wipes out bacteria on the skin’s surface, while vitamin E and vitamin B3 strengthen it.

Luckily for us, the only sensation this serum left on our skin was a pleasant, cool tingling and immediate dewy glow from the jojoba oil.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-94 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Key Ingredients: </strong>Zinc, vitamin B3, jojoba oil, panthenol, beeswax, vitamin E, tea tree oil, bioflavonoids, tinting pigments, and talc<strong> | Product Type: </strong>Serum<strong> | Benefits: </strong>Reduce breakouts | <strong>Size: </strong>0.51 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-uneven-skin-tone-glow-recipe-guava-vitamin-c-dark-spot-treatment-serum></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Uneven Skin Tone</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Glow Recipe Vitamin C Dark Spot Serum</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Glow Recipe Guava Vitamin C Dark Spot Treatment Serum" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/ymtjIG2tpIW7scFAdcEolF2OAT0=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/glow-recipe-guava-vitamin-c-dark-spot-treatment-serum-7517abb758614bbc90f80e5e5bf7c967.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>We loved that it gave our skin an instant brightness, but we were most impressed with our bouncy, plump skin at the end of the testing period.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The slight guava scent was a little sweet for our liking, but it didn’t linger on the skin for very long.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-98 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Glow Recipe truly couldn’t have picked a better name for the brand, as we’ve experienced nothing but deliciously <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>hydrated</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>plump</a> skin every time we try a new product. Once again, right off the bat, this serum acted like a dimmer switch, subtly raising the brilliance of our complexions, and giving it a dumpling-like finish. Although the consistency had the thickness of a traditional moisturizer, it truly did blend into the skin like a serum as advertised—we didn’t wait longer than a minute before we felt good about moving to the next step in our skincare routine.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-99 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Just like everyone else, we’re suckers for immediate gratification, but what truly knocked this formula out of the park was the gentle way it made our dark spots disappear over time, revealing skin that felt impossibly soft and looked so even and consistent like we’d never had a dark spot in our life. Powered by five different forms of vitamin C, the serum strengthens the skin barrier and blocks environmental stressors, like UV rays and pollution, so our existing spots wouldn’t get worse while also preventing new ones from popping up. What’s even better is how it took less than a dime-sized amount of product to reap these benefits, a major score for our wallets.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-100 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Truly, we felt like we were reading the menu of our favorite smoothie shop when we took note of what else was in the formula, like banana, apple, pear, raspberry, and apricot fruit extracts and oils that all together offer an incredible amount of antioxidants that repair and hydrate skin. Our skin looked instantly more radiant after just one application but didn’t increase the shine around our oily T-zone. Still, we knew these fruity extracts and oils were providing long-term benefits as well. These antioxidants also reduce inflammation caused by our environment, and in turn, slow down the aging process, and help to maintain moisture levels.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-101 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Key Ingredients: </strong>Vitamin C, vitamin E, and guava, banana, apple, pear, and raspberry seed oils and extracts<strong>| Product Type: </strong>Serum | <strong>Benefits</strong>: Soothes, hydrates, evens skin tone <strong>| Size: </strong>1 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-our-testing-process></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Our Testing Process</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">After researching the best dark spot correctors available on the market, we narrowed down the list to the 13 most popular products currently available and brought InStyle editors to test the product in our NYC-based Lab. Then, each editor went home with a different dark spot corrector to test as part of our daily skincare routine for the next 12 weeks. We followed the manufacturer’s usage instructions and diligently applied the formula every day, sometimes twice, if the instructions called for it.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Since dark spot correctors are a slow burn, we provided insights at three different check-in points: On day one, at six weeks, and at three months. Then we evaluated our results, ranking each one based on the texture and feel, the level of hydration it provided (or didn’t), any irritation it triggered and — not to sound vain — but how good our skin looked overall, if we had the radiance we wanted and the discoloration we didn’t. After analyzing the data, we ranked the best dark spot correctors that outperformed the others and the top scoring products make up this list.</p><span id=mntl-sc-block-inlinevideo__title_1-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block-inlinevideo__title mntl-text-block">The InStyle Team Tests Dark Spot Correctors</span> <span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-to-keep-in-mind></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What to Keep in Mind</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Formula</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Manhattan-based board-certified dermatologist, Dr. Macrene Alexiades suggests looking for products that, “are working at the root of the matter” to repair the skin and avoid damage that causes brown spots and vulnerability, such as amino acids like glucosamine, aspartic acid, arginine, and citric acid. “Those are gentle and they're safe,” she says, adding that next you can seek out nourishing antioxidants, like a high dose of ferulic acid and vitamins C and E, that will repair the discolored damage without irritating the skin.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Other mainstays, says New York City-based board-certified plastic and reconstructive surgeon, Dr. Umbareen Mahmood, are kojic acid, azelaic acid, tranexamic acid, niacinamide, and retinol.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Skin Type</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“People with acne-prone skin should avoid harsh ingredients and look to ones such as vitamin C, salicylic acid, azelaic acid, and tranexamic acid,” according to Dr. Mahmood.

with sensitive skin, should proceed with caution for products that contain hydroquinone, retinol, and glycolic acid, as they’re not easily tolerated. “If you're going to use glycolic acid or retinol, be aware, it's very irritating,” says Dr. Alexiades Even more surprising, “40 percent of adult women don't tolerate retinoids or glycolic acids,” adds Dr. Alexiades. “If you overuse them, your skin gets thin and it will make the skin weaker.”&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle

avoid harsh ingredients, especially hydroquinone, “as they can cause a white ring around the spot known as the ‘halo effect’,” explains Dr. Mahmood, who adds that these skin tones should “also avoid products with strong acids, or ingredients that can cause inflammation.”&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle

dermatologist, says master esthetician Sarah Akram. “There are different levels of melasma which means that the treatment or method of care will be different,” she adds, explaining that depending on your current skin routine, and what products you are using on your skin, some products make your skin more sensitive than others.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-your-questions-answered></span><h2

causes of dark spots, including sun damage, wounds, hormones, acne scarring, melasma, medication side effects, or certain medical conditions,” explains Dr. Mahmood.” Some studies have even shown that “prolonged exposure to blue light can lead to photoaging and the formation of dark spots.”&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle

can also add a blue light screen protector to your devices. “We probably are accumulating some light damage just from looking at screens,” warns Dr. Alexiades. “Even if we have any light source in front of us, if we're in front of it long enough, sooner or later, those wavelengths are gonna get into the skin, to the DNA, and can cause trouble.” Just another reason why you should take a quick
