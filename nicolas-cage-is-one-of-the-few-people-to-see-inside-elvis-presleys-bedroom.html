His smooth voice, heartfelt beats and emotional lyrics pushed him to the world’s center stage. After Elvis Presley’s death, fans around the globe have still remembered the late icon, with his former home Graceland becoming a monument to the star. But when it comes to the King’s private bedroom, only Nicolas Cage and Elvis Presley’s immediate family have had the privilege of stepping inside.</strong></p><p>The former home of Elvis Presley was made into a huge complex honoring the <a href=#>music</a> star. It features museums, restaurants, gift shops and memorabilia of the <a href=#>celebrity</a> who died in 1977 – almost 50 years ago. The American actor and singer bought the impressive 13-acre mansion in Memphis, Tennessee for his family after skyrocketing to stardom. Now, none of the Presley family members live at the estate, but it’s currently owned by Riley Keough, Elvis Presley’s granddaughter through the late Lisa Marie. But there are some areas of the property off limits, like Elvis Presley’s bedroom – somewhere <a href=#>Nicolas Cage</a> has had the rare honor of seeing inside.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-nicolas-cage-was-given-exclusive-access-to-elvis-presley-s-private-bedroom>Nicolas Cage was given exclusive access to Elvis Presley’s private bedroom</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/01/GettyImages-74290647-812x1024.jpg><p>One of Elvis Presley’s die-hard fans is actor Nicolas Cage. He even called the legendary singer his “hero” in an <a href=# rel=nofollow>interview</a>, but has had special access to the star millions others will never have in their lifetime.</p><p>The <a href=#>Hollywood</a> star was married to Elvis’ daughter, Lisa Marie, and she allowed him to enter the room. Aside from Cage and the star’s immediate family, he is one of the few people to cast his eyes at his Graceland bedroom after he passed away.</p><p>It’s an incredible brag because so few people have actually seen inside in real life. Graceland denies tours, filming, photos or even general visitors in to his bedroom, so the mystery behind it is quite remarkable. Former President Bill Clinton even sent a private request to see inside Elvis Presley, and he was turned down – so Nicolas Cage trumped him on that.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-movie-star-laid-on-his-bed-and-tried-on-his-clothes>Movie star ‘laid on his bed and tried on his clothes’</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/01/GettyImages-1422354388-1024x683.jpg><p>The <a href=#>movie</a> star stepped inside the King’s grand suite during the week of the 25th anniversary of Elvis’ death. Photographer Eric Hatheway – a major Elvis fan himself – later <a href=# rel=nofollow>claimed</a> the National Treasure actor “laid on the singer’s bed and tried on a leather jacket”. But Cage has never confirmed these rumors, so they could just be intriguing stories.</p><p>Cage and Lisa Marie hit it off at a part in 2000. They fell in love and tied the knot two years later in a summer wedding. Although, it wasn’t written in the stars, as they filed for divorce a mere three months later. In 2004, they were officially split and Cage admitted they had a difficult relationship.</p><p>He <a href=# rel=nofollow>told</a> Baraba Walters a year after getting wed: “We got into this unfortunate pattern of breaking up and getting back together again.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-elvis-presley-s-bedroom-is-now-chained-shut-for-good>Elvis Presley’s bedroom is now chained shut for good</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/01/GettyImages-85240037-1024x677.jpg><p>Even if the Ghost Rider star wanted to visit again, that’s now not possible.</p><p>Elvis’ had heavy double doors installed for soundproofing, and now they’ve been chained shut. His bedroom is locked for good to keep the room in pristine condition with no visitors whatsoever.</p><p>For Elvis fans who are venturing to Graceland, will get to see the staircase leading up to the second floor where it resides. However, there are guards situated at the top and bottom of the stairs, so even if you wanted a quick sneak peek, it’s not happening.</p><p>The bathroom, where Elvis died, has also been <a href=# rel=nofollow>locked</a> since his death back in August 1977. The room is connected to his master suite, so Cage wouldn’t have taken a look in during his private tour either.</p><p>Long-time employees of the estate also avoid the quarters.</p><p>It’s said only Priscilla Presley, Elvis’ wife, Lisa-Marie, his daughter and the curator of Graceland have been in his private bedroom – on and of course, Nicolas Cage.</p><p>Hailed as one of the most cultural significant singers of the 20th century, the star passed away on August 16, 1977, at his home in Graceland. Although many fans may think his name was just for the stage, but he was born with it, in 1935. He passed away suddenly, with his fiancée at the time, Ginger Alden, in the next room. The star died from a heart attack, with the preliminary autopsy findings reporting cardiac arrhythmia following years of prescription drug use. Prescription drugs were found in his blood in toxicology testing, but were not a contributing factor.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlpX2WGcLrInKalmaNisKKzxGagrGWfo7Juu8Vmq6GdXZuyuHnPnqappJViwbB50p6cZqGeqLalsYyeo6%2Bho2K9s7HSpZyyq12XsqW%2BzqikaA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./op-ed-chuck-berry-by-bob-lefsetz.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Op-Ed: Chuck Berry  By Bob Lefsetz">&larr;
