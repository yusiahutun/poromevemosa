The 10-episode season saw marketing exec Emily (Lily Collins) continuing to embrace the City of Light, with a few faux pas along the way. She even (finally) sets out to learn the language, joining a French class where she meets British finance bro Alfie. Soon enough, she ends up in yet another love triangle, this time involving Alfie and her lingering love, Gabriel.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The season ends in a cliffhanger: Will Emily stay in Paris? In the final scene, the marketing wiz must choose between a possible dream promotion at Savior's Chicago offices or a place at Sylvie's brand-new agency in Paris. But the show ends before we learn her decision.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Luckily for fans left hanging, a third season of Netflix's <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://variety.com/2021/tv/news/emily-in-paris-season-2-french-culture-darren-star-interview-1234966192/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="biggest comedy of 2020" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">biggest comedy of 2020</a> has been confirmed. Here's what we know so far about Season 3.</p><h2 data-node-id=5 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Netflix announced that Seasons 3 and 4 are a go.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Both Netflix and Lily Collins shared the renewal news on social media. Collins broke the news with a series of selfies featuring her wearing a DIY Emily in Paris merch tee. She also revealed that a fourth season had been green-lit.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"Woke up early to give you some VERY exciting news… @emilyinparis is back for Season 3… AND wait for it, Season 4!!!!! I can't tell if Emily would love or hate this announcement outfit but she'd be screaming either way," Collins wrote on Instagram. "Truly love you all, thanks so much for the incredible support. Seriously cannot wait for more. Merci Beaucoup!!…"</p><h2 data-node-id=10 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Emily in Paris Season 3 premieres on December 21, 2022.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Netflix announced that Season 3 will arrive this December, dropping the news along with a teaser as part of the streamer's annual fan event, Tudum. The clip (seen above) signals that some rocky times could be ahead for the Parisian transplant, as we hear Emily say, "This is the hardest decision I have ever had to make," right before she cuts her own bangs.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Though she later assures Gabriel that "sometimes people cut bangs when everything's fine," it looks like Emily will face some tough changes as she deals with the aftermath of her decision to either stay in Paris or move away.</p><h2 data-node-id=13 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">See a first look at Season 3.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The whole gang is back in Paris in teaser images from Season 3 released by Netflix.</p><img alt="emily in paris l to r lily collins as emily, lucien laviscount as alfie in episode 303 of emily in paris cr stéphanie branchunetflix © 2022" title="emily in paris l to r lily collins as emily, lucien laviscount as alfie in episode 303 of emily in paris cr stéphanie branchunetflix © 2022" width=1920 height=1280 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/eip-303-unit-00889r-1663854870.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2"></span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Netflix</span></p><img alt="emily in paris l to r ashley park as mindy, lily collins as emily, camille razat as camille in episode 301 of emily in paris cr stéphanie branchunetflix © 2022" title="emily in paris l to r ashley park as mindy, lily collins as emily, camille razat as camille in episode 301 of emily in paris cr stéphanie branchunetflix © 2022" width=1920 height=1280 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/eip-301-unit-02187r-1663855022.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2"></span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Netflix</span></p><img alt="emily in paris l to r philippine leroy beaulieu as sylvie grateau, samuel arnold as julien, bruno gouery as luc in episode 305 of emily in paris cr stéphanie branchunetflix © 2022" title="emily in paris l to r philippine leroy beaulieu as sylvie grateau, samuel arnold as julien, bruno gouery as luc in episode 305 of emily in paris cr stéphanie branchunetflix © 2022" width=1920 height=1280 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/eip-305-unit-02428r-1663855066.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2"></span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Netflix</span></p><img alt="emily in paris l to r lucas bravo as gabriel, lily collins as emily in episode 305 of emily in paris cr marie etchegoyennetflix © 2022" title="emily in paris l to r lucas bravo as gabriel, lily collins as emily in episode 305 of emily in paris cr marie etchegoyennetflix © 2022" width=1920 height=1280 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/eip-305-unit-00964r-1663855122.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2"></span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Netflix</span></p><h2 data-node-id=19 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Darren Star says Emily's choice will make some people unhappy.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Collins told <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://people.com/tv/emily-in-paris-lily-collins-talks-season-2-cliffhanger-cast-hopes-for-possible-season-3/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=People class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">People</a> that even she has no idea which choice her character makes. "I would love the opportunity to get to do a Season 3. I myself don't know her choice yet. I keep asking," she told the outlet. "But whatever choice it is you know it will be filled with drama, fashion and a lot of fun and romance."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Showrunner Darren Star isn't dropping any hints, but he does have an idea for how the show will go forward. "I have a very strong idea [of what Emily chooses], and I think the thing is, there's no right choice," he told <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.elle.com/culture/movies-tv/a38602209/emily-in-paris-season-2-ending-explained/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=ELLE.com class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">ELLE.com</a>. "There's no choice that's gonna make everything better and please everybody. And I think Emily also is…a bit of a people pleaser, and she's gonna make a decision that's gonna make some people unhappy. And she's gonna have to deal with that also next season."</p><h2 data-node-id=22 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Season 3 could also see Emily head to London.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">According to <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://variety.com/2022/tv/news/emily-in-paris-season-3-4-netflix-1235149747/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Variety class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Variety</a>, next season will shoot on the outskirts of Paris this spring or summer, although other destinations, including London, are being explored. It would make sense for Emily to visit London if she chooses to take on a long-distance relationship with her Season 2 love interest, Alfie. Speaking of Alfie …</p><h2 data-node-id=24 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Lucien Laviscount is up for returning.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">When asked about Season 3, the actor told <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/film-tv/a38552863/lucien-laviscount-emily-in-paris-interview/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=BAZAAR.com class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">BAZAAR.com</a> that he'd be happy to return as long as his character still serves Emily's story.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"Who knows about Season 3?" he said. "I had the best year of my life working on the show and working with these people. So if I'm back, I'm back, but as long as I serve the storyline and serve Emily's story and do a good job, that's what matters."</p><h2 data-node-id=27 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Emily may recycle some of her outfits in Season 3.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The fashion is one of the most-discussed parts of Emily in Paris, whether for its chicness (Sylvie and Camille), boldness (Emily and Mindy), or distance from reality (20-somethings who don't re-wear outfits). As for that last point, costume designer Marylin Fitoussi already has some ideas about how that can change for Season 3.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Fitoussi told <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.elle.com/culture/movies-tv/a38580829/emily-in-paris-season-2-best-looks-and-where-to-get-them/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=ELLE.com class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">ELLE.com</a> that she would like to bring back some unforgettable outfits from Season 1, specifically Emily's looks.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"My dream for season 3 would be to recycle costumes [from] Season 1," she told the outlet. "I don't know if we can do that, but I'm dreaming to bring some of Lily's most iconic outfits to the recycling workshop and see what they can do and recut and make."<br></p><h2 data-node-id=31 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Lily Collins says Season 3 will have "more love triangles [and] more drama."</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=32 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">While speaking to <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.etonline.com/lily-collins-teases-more-love-triangles-and-drama-in-emily-in-paris-season-3-exclusive-192678 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Entertainment Weekly" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Entertainment Weekly</a>, Collins dropped some hints about what to expect in the new episodes.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=33 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"More love triangles, more drama, more laughs, more fashion, more locations, more France!" she said, adding that the show's early renewal for Season 4 means there's room for "a lot of cliffhangers."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=34 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The star also spoke on her work behind the scenes as a producer on the project.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=35 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"It's been incredible," she said. "I've learned so much and I'm super grateful for the team to inspire me to continue voicing myself and owning my ideas, and it's been a dream job."</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/81e105b4-86bd-4dab-a1f8-e00063b9e433_1609381211.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Quinci LeGardye" title="Headshot of Quinci LeGardye" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Quinci LeGardye is an LA-based freelance writer who covers culture, politics, and mental health through a Black feminist lens.
